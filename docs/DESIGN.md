# TetraMorph — Product Design Contract

> The current page-facing identity is the plain-text `TetraMorph`. Older `Tetra` and
> `Tetris` headings below are retained only as historical contract provenance.

## 2026-08-06 T34 — Responsive gravity instrument audio

**Status: ACCEPTED.** Contract `26c7956`, audio foundation `74bdb96`, priority palette
`aadf593`, secondary palette/runtime bridge `a99a934`, browser evidence `67325a9`, and
independent read-only QA all pass. T34 replaces the accumulated per-effect audio
styling with one original world rule: **TetraMorph is a calm, responsive gravity
instrument.** Sound answers every meaningful action, but it never becomes a mineral
striking demo, a hard-sci-fi alarm bank, an arcade explosion reel, or background music.

The mix language is approximately 40% ambient electronic tone, 30% soft acoustic
texture, 20% crystal/glass resonance, and 10% restrained mechanism. Perceived emphasis
is monotonic: move < rotate < lock < clear < Mutation < four-line clear / completion.
Loudness alone may not create that hierarchy; duration, harmonic width, low-frequency
body, spatial tail, and temporary voice ownership carry the larger rewards.

### Synthesis and routing contract

- Keep the existing Web Audio implementation, deterministic sources, volume setting,
  sixteen transient-voice ceiling, and close-on-destroy lifecycle. Do not add licensed
  music, external samples, a sample pack, or a persistent browser/server dependency.
- Replace the single undifferentiated effect path with five explicit buses:
  **Gameplay**, **Reward**, **Mutation**, **Ambient**, and **UI**. Every cue names one
  owner bus, and the master compressor remains the final safety boundary.
- A designed cue may layer two oscillators, a small deterministic filtered-noise
  texture, and a quiet delayed spatial tail. Layers share one semantic cue and must not
  each masquerade as a separate gameplay event.
- High-frequency controls stay concise and rate-limited. Resolution cues may suppress
  same-frame lock/drop transients; a Mutation activation plays once per unique item in
  the existing canonical event order. No active Mutation owns a sustained loop.
- The Ambient bus is a barely audible procedural room tone, not music: Deep Tide is a
  low-passed deep-sea/instrument breath, Mineral Mist is an airy crystalline haze, and
  Sunstone is a warm, slow harmonic bed. It starts only after audio is primed, follows
  the selected visual theme, obeys enable/volume, and stops without leaks.

### Cue grammar

- Move: a roughly 40 ms soft pluck with a trace of air around 220–280 Hz. Rotate: a
  roughly 70 ms upward sweep with a muted click. Soft drop: a roughly 30 ms descending
  air cue. These remain quieter than physical contact.
- Hard drop: restrained 80 Hz body, soft 150 Hz impact, and a quiet upper spatial tail,
  roughly 180 ms total. Ordinary lock is a shorter settle resonance and cannot sound
  heavier than hard drop.
- Clear rewards are distinct compositions rather than one chord transposed upward:
  single is a soft crystal sweep, double adds a stable fifth, triple opens into a short
  ascending pad and bell, and four-line clear becomes the branded 0.8–1.0 second
  “space unfolding” moment with low body, open C/G harmony, and a glass tail. The
  player must identify the clear size by contour even at modest volume.
- Ice blooms with a few soft glass/snow particles and a slow pad, then ends with a
  quiet thaw crack. Supergravity is one deep soft pulse with a 200→80 Hz descent and a
  restrained reverse release; its five-piece gameplay ownership does not create a
  sustained tone. Bomb uses pressure build, soft impact, and space tail rather than a
  gunshot. Multiplier uses harmonic expansion: two notes for x2, three for x4.
- Survival bedrock rise is a one-second low pad and movement texture, stone warning is
  a natural low pulse rather than an alarm, and stone landing has more body than an
  ordinary lock without becoming harsh.
- UI hover remains silent. Confirmation is a very light tick; a modal transition is a
  low soft swell. Entry countdown retains its accepted three-part cadence and is not
  broadened by this phase.

### Acceptance boundary

Direct tests prove bus routing, deterministic layered schedules, hierarchy, same-frame
suppression, theme ambience ownership, enable/volume behavior, the sixteen-voice
transient cap, and complete cleanup. Typecheck, the complete `391 passed / 8 skipped`
suite, and production build pass. The bounded browser audit records enabled 100% audio,
mute/restore, a live 64% volume change, all three theme selections, one Canvas, zero DOM
board cells, and zero console/page errors; lifecycle teardown remains directly proven by
the unit boundary rather than inferred from a screenshot. Existing T27 evidence and
`progress.md` remain untouched and unstaged. Cross-device loudness and timbre preference
remain a human listening boundary, not an automated acceptance claim.

## 2026-08-06 T33 — Supergravity covers five pieces

**Status: ACCEPTED.** Product source `60c3fdd`, rule-copy repair `909f904`, final
browser evidence `b887994`, and independent read-only QA all pass. Mutation
Supergravity changes from elapsed-time ownership to a deterministic five-piece budget.
Clearing a Supergravity carrier sets the number of future covered spawns to five. A
spawn atomically consumes one unit and copies the effect into that active piece's
immutable landing latch.

The remaining budget and the active-piece latch are deliberately different state:

- the budget answers how many *future* pieces will receive Supergravity;
- the latch answers whether the *current* piece uses independent-column projection and
  settlement;
- timer ticks, pause duration, input rate, render frames, and row-wise entry do not
  affect either claim;
- after the fifth spawn consumes the last unit, its latch remains true until that piece
  locks, so preview and settlement cannot diverge at the boundary;
- another Supergravity award refreshes the future budget to five rather than adding
  five, while an already-airborne latched piece remains latched.

The status ledger communicates discrete ownership, not time: it shows the remaining
piece count and has no seconds label or continuously draining time meter. Activation
feedback may remain short-lived presentation, but it must not imply that gameplay
ownership expires by time.

## 2026-08-06 T32 — accepted Puzzle curriculum rebuild

Accepted source `9092402`; browser evidence `75cc2f9`; final independent QA PASS.

Puzzle anchors are fixed world obstacles and physical supports. During a line clear,
an already-settled connected piece resting on an anchor retains its complete geometry
and world coordinates; the clear may move unsupported cells, but may not split or pull
the supported piece around its anchor. Target-cell tracking uses this same mapping.

**Status: ACTIVE / BOARD AUTHORING ADMITTED.** T31-R2 is accepted on product/test source
`432fde4` with browser evidence through `f859d68` and an independent P0/P1/P2/P3-zero
verdict for exact range `c291afb..532e636`. The renewed audit proves the live campaign is
still 3/27/20, later Easy access is tier-gated, the three existing exact certificates
will be invalidated by the Intro rebuild, and no gating certificate is directly
reusable. The isolated structural / symmetry / near-topology fingerprint foundation is
green at `da8e2b9`, and the roster/technique contract is committed. Board authoring is
therefore admitted under the exact-proof and duplicate-rejection boundary below.

T32 replaces the current Puzzle curriculum without changing the total
campaign size: **50 levels = 10 Intro + 20 Easy + 20 Hard**. The ten Intro boards are
all rebuilt as authored teaching puzzles; Intro remains immediately available. All
twenty Easy levels are immediately available and never depend on prior completion or
operation-count gates. The twenty Hard levels are mastery-gated: each Hard puzzle names
one certified Easy prerequisite whose route demonstrates the same technique and the
same decisive board-reading problem.

### Curriculum and duplicate policy

- Difficulty is assigned from replay evidence and board decisions, not from the old
  row band or historical position alone. Intro isolates one teachable decision, Easy
  asks the player to apply it without a forced sequence, and Hard combines it with a
  materially tighter or misleading continuation.
- Exact duplicate boards are forbidden. Near-duplicates are compared through a
  symmetry-normalized occupancy/anchor fingerprint plus route-critical decisions;
  renaming, mirroring, changing colors, or moving one non-decisive cell is not a new
  puzzle.
- The near-repeated boards currently occupying campaign positions 36, 38, and 47 are
  replaced, respectively, by an authored **lower-triangle**, **pyramid**, and
  **two-sided suspended-roof with a hollow middle** residue. Their geometry must remain
  legal under the existing deterministic setup contract rather than being painted or
  injected directly into runtime state.
- Strict public-Core replay probes also reject the legacy tails at positions 46, 48,
  49, and 50: none completes within the frozen twenty-two-lock proof ceiling. Those
  positions retain their deterministic setup prefixes but are rebuilt as distinct
  six-row residues with registered successful replay witnesses.
- Names, ordering, categories, lesson copy, and unlock relations are derived only after
  the final boards and replay evidence are frozen. A stable ID may be retained for a
  replaced slot only with an explicit campaign-revision migration; stale best counts
  may not masquerade as records for a different board.
- Stable positions 01-10 remain the rebuilt Intro IDs, 11-30 remain the Easy IDs, and
  31-50 remain the Hard IDs. The changed set is exactly 01-10, 12-14, 36, 38, and 46-50;
  campaign revision 2 preserves records only for unchanged geometry and clears
  completion/best data for those twenty changed IDs. Easy positions 12-14 are the
  rebuilt strict-mastery boards whose exact certificates drive the Hard unlock graph.
- The directly supported anchor-free mastery candidate pool is positions 12-15, 17-21,
  23-25, and 28-30. A final Easy-to-Hard map is not design truth until exact optimum
  certificates and three-part replay signatures are checked; the contract does not
  invent optimum numbers or relationships in advance.
- The authoritative authoring roster, Intro decision matrix, Easy technique families,
  candidate Hard proof map, first exact-certificate set, and revision-2 artifact fields
  are frozen in `docs/phases/t32-puzzle-curriculum-rebuild.md`. A candidate relation is
  not an unlock until exhaustive optimum and replay-signature checks pass.

### T31-R2 regression gate before board authoring

The player review superseded the visual sufficiency of the older T31 evidence
for three bounded claims. Mutation status must be more prominent while remaining a
frameless signal/name/thin-line ledger; Next must be visibly populated in both Classic
and Mutation active play; and a piece that latched Supergravity while airborne must
retain independent-column lock and the same complete projected landing after the global
timer expires. Source `432fde4`, responsive evidence through `f859d68`, recorded final
gates, resource teardown, and independent QA close these claims. No Reshape, new item,
status cards, or broader Mutation redesign was admitted.

Prominence is carried by hierarchy, not another container: concurrent rows use a
stronger heading, larger item signal and name, clearer row spacing, and a still-thin
item-colored lifetime line. Next is a Canvas-rendered instrument whose transparent DOM
anchor is resolved inside the current gameplay arena and clamped to that arena's live
Canvas geometry; a global first-match query is not authoritative. Acceptance records
actual preview pixels in Classic and Mutation at 1440 × 900 and 1125 × 1196, not only a
queue value or renderer visibility flag. The Supergravity latch is bound to the active
piece generation, so row-wise entry, movement, rotation, timer expiry, complete ghost
projection, and independent-column lock all consult the same retained decision until
that piece locks. The next generation begins rigid when no global timer remains.

### Solvability and mastery evidence

- Every new or changed board has at least **two distinct successful routes** replayed
  from the registered initial state through public Core commands only: move, rotate,
  soft drop, and hard drop. Direct state mutation, private landing injection, renderer
  coordinates, and solver-only commands are invalid evidence.
- Both routes must clear every original ordinary cell while preserving anchor rules,
  fixed queue order, collision, line-clear timing, and ordinary lock semantics. A
  route is evidence only after deterministic Core replay reaches the canonical Puzzle
  completion state.
- Any Easy puzzle used as a Hard unlock prerequisite additionally carries an exhaustive
  **strict minimum placed-piece certificate**. Its mastery threshold is exactly
  `optimal placed pieces + 5`; a bounded beam-search result or best route found so far
  cannot set this threshold.
- Mastery prerequisites form a small technique curriculum rather than a one-off gate per
  Hard board. Each prerequisite is a deliberate at-most-seven-piece teaching puzzle and
  may unlock multiple Hard boards that reuse its certified decision pattern.
- An auditable technique signature links each certified Easy puzzle to its dependent
  Hard puzzle(s). The signature includes measurable initial-board preconditions, the
  route's decisive placement/clear event, and the post-decision invariant that makes
  the continuation work. Tests must derive or verify those facts against replayed
  states. A handwritten technique label without matching board and route assertions
  cannot unlock a Hard level.
- Each Hard level has exactly one visible mastery prerequisite and cannot be unlocked
  by generic completion totals. One certified Easy level may unlock several Hard
  levels only when every dependent level proves the same technique signature and
  strengthens the same key decision rather than sharing a broad topic name.

### T32 acceptance boundary

T32 acceptance requires campaign validators for the 10/20/20 split, duplicate and
near-duplicate rejection, all-open Intro/Easy access, mastery-only Hard access, two
Core-replayed routes for every changed board, exhaustive optimality for every mastery
prerequisite, and technique-signature correspondence. Final typecheck, complete suite,
production build, one bounded browser pass across all three pages/categories, migrated
progress behavior, one Canvas, zero browser errors, and independent read-only QA are
required before the coordinator may call the rebuild complete. This queued contract is
not implementation or verification evidence.

## 2026-08-05 T31 — Mutation gravity, ice, and status clarity

**Status: ACCEPTED / CLOSED.** Product/test source `7c4a9a1`, evidence `735effe`,
final gates, and independent read-only QA pass with no P0-P3 findings.

T31 is a bounded correction to Mutation mode. It removes the Reshape carrier from the
live product, makes Supergravity landing guidance obey the same per-piece latch as Core,
and replaces the rejected Supergravity/Ice feedback with shorter, local, readable
effects. Scoring, Bomb, Multiplier, ordinary clears, themes, layout, navigation, Puzzle,
Survival, persistence, and the single-Canvas boundary remain unchanged.

T31 also carries one direct clarification into the already accepted T30 arrival
presentation: a newly spawned tetromino enters **row by row**, not cell by cell. This is
real board-mouth travel, not an opacity/scale reveal. Core keeps its canonical hidden
spawn rows; the lower occupied row appears first in visible board row 1, then higher
rows cross the board mouth on the configured gravity beat while lower rows advance.
Rendering clips at the board mouth and does not shift the whole piece into view. Spawn
coordinates, collision, queue, gravity timing, and deterministic state remain unchanged.

### Four-item live contract

- The live Mutation pool contains exactly Ice, Supergravity, Bomb, and Multiplier.
  Reshape is removed from the type, deterministic pool, activation logic, renderer,
  audio, tokens, theme material map, localization, rules, and active tests. Historical
  documentation may retain the name only as provenance.
- A carrier still activates at most once even when several of its cells clear together.
  Multiple different carriers resolved in one batch retain deterministic priority.
- Supergravity still lasts five seconds for newly active pieces. A piece that was
  airborne while Supergravity was active keeps independent-column landing semantics
  until that piece locks, even if the global timer expires first. Both the ghost guide
  and the final lock use `timer active OR piece latch`; the settled board cells,
  `piece-locked` event, lock pulse, and hard-drop trail all use the same final per-column
  coordinates. The next piece does not inherit an expired effect.

### Activation, clear, and sustained feedback

- Ice activation/clear uses a board-local burst of four small six-arm snowflakes released
  from the consumed carrier cells. It must not recolor the whole board, create scan
  lines, or mask the ordinary playfield.
- Supergravity activation/clear uses five compact gravity-factor particles released from
  the consumed carrier columns. Each has a dense purple kite and a short downward
  chevron tail; it must not read as a symbol, explosion, screen flash, pressure ribbon,
  or full-width bar.
- While an airborne piece is Supergravity-latched, the rejected spike trail is replaced
  by two or three soft, clipped rectangular afterimages behind its moving cells. The
  trail never survives a lock and does not render in reduced motion.
- Supergravity has no sustained oscillator, expiry tone, or special landing sound/VFX.
  Its short activation cue remains distinct; ordinary locking keeps the ordinary lock
  contract. Reduced motion renders one local static activation endpoint and omits
  travelling shards, pressure streaks, and trails.

### Mutation status ledger

- The left rail keeps the established heading, item signal, localized name, and one
  one-pixel remaining-time line. Visible `生效中` / `Active` and seconds are removed;
  remaining time stays in the row's accessible label. Active effects are rows in one visual ledger, not separate
  cards: no row background, outline, radius, inset stripe, or shadow.
- Idle state remains intentionally empty beneath the heading; no placeholder sentence,
  decorative rule, or disabled-state box is shown. Simultaneous effects remain legible
  through their item color, signal, name, and thin time line only, with enough fixed row
  spacing that concurrent effects never overlap.
- Frameless does not mean faint: the heading, signal, and item name use a stronger
  typographic hierarchy, and the one-pixel item-colored meter may use a restrained glow.
  No background card, visible countdown, pill, or separator is added.

### T31-R1 correction

- Row arrival must expose the canonical lower occupied row first at visible board row 1.
  A higher occupied row then crosses the clipped board mouth only after the current
  gravity interval while the lower slice advances. The complete final landing guide is
  available as soon as the lower slice is visible; it does not wait for the higher row.
  Fixed reveal timers, row opacity/scale staging, and whole-piece clamping are rejected.
- Ice activation uses four small carrier-local snowflakes. Supergravity uses five local
  gravity factors that separate and fall from the consumed columns. Neither may use a
  whole-board recolor, hard scan line, central symbol, pressure ribbon, full-width bar,
  or screen flash.
- Next is rendered by Pixi on a dedicated unmasked plane anchored to the transparent DOM
  slot. The active-piece board-mouth mask cannot clip it. It remains visible through
  board-local pause/restart/leave interruptions and is hidden only before play, after a
  terminal state, or during actual route teardown.
- When the global Supergravity timer reaches zero, an already latched airborne piece
  retains the same independent-column ghost and final settlement until lock. Expiry
  removes only the global status; the next piece is the first rigid piece.
- The correction contract and evidence boundary are frozen in
  `docs/phases/t31-r1-status-and-arrival-correction.md`.

### T31 acceptance

Focused Core/presentation tests must prove the four-item pool and latched Supergravity
ghost/lock agreement. Renderer tests must freeze the new Ice and Supergravity activation
geometry, the clipped non-spike trail, reduced-motion endpoint, and absence of Reshape.
Audio tests must prove Supergravity state sync creates no sustained voice and that no
Reshape cue remains. UI/style tests must prove frameless status rows with no visible
active-state copy or seconds. After the final
source edit, run one typecheck, the complete suite, one production build, and one bounded
browser pass covering Ice activation, Supergravity before/after timer expiry, status
layout, row-grouped active-piece arrival, one Canvas, zero DOM board cells, zero console
errors, and teardown.

## 2026-08-04 T30 — in-well piece arrival and route transitions

T30 adds two bounded motion contracts without changing Core simulation, input timing,
randomization, scoring, layouts, themes, audio, or the single-Canvas boundary. A newly
active tetromino must read as entering the playfield instead of appearing fully formed
in one frame, while page changes must have a short spatial handoff instead of a hard
cut. Both effects are presentation-only and must remain safe under reduced motion.

### Active-piece arrival

- Core remains authoritative: the piece still spawns in the same hidden rows with the
  same coordinates and collision state. Rendering continues to project all four cells
  wholly inside the visible well before any arrival effect is applied.
- A new active generation is identified by the run's placed-piece count plus the active
  piece identity. Its occupied rows assemble in a deterministic top-to-bottom stagger
  over no more than 210 ms. Every cell in one row shares the same reveal progress, so a
  row enters as one readable slice before the next row begins. Each cell grows and gains
  opacity at its already-safe in-well position; no cell travels through, clips against,
  or appears outside the board frame.
- The ghost landing guide remains hidden until the materialisation is substantially
  readable, then joins quietly. Movement and rotation interpolation continue from the
  canonical active piece and must not restart the arrival.
- Restart, Puzzle undo, terminal state, unmount, and reduced-motion changes clear the
  renderer-owned arrival state. Reduced motion presents the complete legal endpoint
  immediately, with no stagger or scale travel.

### Page handoff

- Home, Puzzle library, and game URLs remain the navigation authority. Every actual
  route change through push, replace, or browser history uses one shared transition
  boundary; selection changes that do not change the URL do not animate the page.
- Supporting browsers receive a restrained 180 ms old-page fade/settle and 220 ms
  new-page fade/rise. The fallback remounts only the route surface and applies a short
  entry fade, without delaying history or changing focus ownership.
- Reduced motion suppresses translation and collapses the handoff to an effectively
  immediate opacity change. Transitions may not create a second Canvas, preserve a
  hidden gameplay runtime, intercept controls after navigation, or start a persistent
  timer/service.

### T30 acceptance

Focused renderer tests must freeze generation identity, cell staggering, ghost delay,
in-well bounds, restart/undo cleanup, and the reduced-motion endpoint. Navigation tests
must freeze URL behavior, browser-history transitions, fallback behavior, and the CSS
reduced-motion contract. After the last source edit, run one typecheck, the complete
suite, one production build, and one bounded browser pass showing the arrival sequence
and two route changes with one Canvas and zero browser errors.

### T30 acceptance disposition

Product source `19a17e6` and evidence `2da8a37` satisfy the frozen contract. The
renderer stages each new generation at already-safe visible coordinates over 204 ms,
delays the ghost, and clears its presentation state across lifecycle boundaries. Home,
Puzzle library, and gameplay use one route surface with native View Transitions where
available, a CSS entry fallback, and a transform-free reduced-motion endpoint. Final
typecheck, `372 passed / 3 skipped`, the production build, and the Chromium audit pass
with one Canvas, zero DOM board cells, zero browser errors, and zero audit failures.
Independent read-only QA accepts `dc2aaad..2da8a37` with P0–P3 all zero.

## 2026-08-04 T29 — complete SFX remaster

T29 is one bounded procedural-audio remaster. Player review rejects the accepted T28
mix as globally too soft: increasing the master alone is not an acceptable repair,
because it would make repeated input abrasive while leaving event hierarchy unclear.
This slice therefore supersedes T28's literal "soft-edged" balance for audio only with
**defined, responsive, and non-fatiguing** feedback. It does not change gameplay,
visuals, timing, scoring, localization, themes, music, or the single-Canvas boundary.

### Dynamic hierarchy and material language

The mix uses one shared procedural instrument family with three intentionally separate
roles. Each role is audible at the default 100% setting, and higher-priority feedback
must remain identifiable when events share a frame.

1. **Controls** — horizontal move and soft drop stay single-voice, short, and
   rate-limited. Rotation gains a rounded two-part turn rather than a sharp click.
   Gravity lock remains quieter than hard drop, and hard drop uses a compact body/contact
   pair without a sub-bass tail.
2. **State and hazard** — undo, pause/resume, bedrock motion, rock warning/spawn/landing,
   and level-up receive distinct direction, register, and duration. Repetition must not
   create an alarm, burst, electrical buzz, or explosive transient.
3. **Reward and resolution** — one through four cleared lines form an ascending family
   with progressively more harmonic body, stereo-independent temporal spread, and a
   longer resolved tail. Four lines are the strongest repeatable gameplay reward.
   Mutation activation, Puzzle completion, and terminal results retain higher semantic
   priority and must not be mistaken for ordinary clears.

At 100% volume, presence comes from cue-specific midrange fundamentals, a restrained
triangle body where useful, 3–8 ms attacks, and deliberate 70–300 ms envelopes. It must
not come from clipping, a full-band noise wash, a global gain jump, or a large persistent
loop. The master path preserves transient contrast with a bounded ceiling and compressor;
every individual voice stays below the fixed gain ceiling and total live voices remain
at or below sixteen.

### Event contracts

- One/two/three/four-line clears schedule 2/3/4/5 voices respectively, are materially
  stronger than a move tick, and increase monotonically in aggregate peak energy.
- The same-batch resolution order remains Mutation activation, completion/game-over/
  level-up, ordinary clear, hard drop, gravity lock. A lower item cannot mask or double
  the event that owns the resolution.
- Ice is a short crystalline confirmation without a persistent tone; Supergravity is
  a weight-and-settle pair with only its already-bounded low ambience; Bomb is a compact
  low body plus filtered air; Reshape is a fast three-facet rewrite; Double and Super
  Double use distinct two- and three-step mallet signatures. Duplicate same-item events
  still trigger once.
- Countdown remains three unmistakable transport beats: `3` and `2` repeat, `1` is
  higher and longer. `started` and `restarted` remain silent so the first countdown beat
  is never doubled.
- SFX enablement, volume, suspend, restart, Mutation expiry, and destroy retain strict
  ownership. No sample asset, music loop, new dependency, timer queue, AudioContext, or
  persistent background service is introduced.

### T29 acceptance

Direct scheduling tests must freeze each event family's voice count, contour, ordering,
relative peak hierarchy, rate limit, invalid-input refusal, same-frame suppression,
sixteen-voice ceiling, and lifecycle cleanup. After the final source edit, run one
typecheck, the complete test suite, one production build, and one source-bound browser
runtime audit proving SFX enable/volume routing, countdown ownership, one Canvas, zero
browser errors, and complete teardown. Perceptual acceptance is based on the declared
hierarchy and real playback; a higher numeric gain alone is not evidence of completion.

### T29 accepted evidence

The accepted product source is `ca5da48`, with source-bound browser evidence at
`abce548`. Direct audio coverage passes `29/29`; final typecheck, the complete suite
(`365 passed / 3 skipped`), and the 759-module production build pass. The browser audit
proves 2/3/4/5-voice clear tiers, a bounded 12-voice dense Mutation batch, real
enable/volume/suspend routing, 31 AudioContexts each closed exactly once, one Canvas,
zero DOM board cells, and zero browser errors or audit failures. Independent read-only
QA accepts exact range `dfb9fbb7..abce548` with P0 0 / P1 0 / P2 0 / P3 0.

## 2026-08-04 T28 — ordinary line-clear release polish

T28 is one bounded Release Polish slice for the shared ordinary clear. It supersedes
the 2026-07-30 ordinary-clear rollback only for the feedback described here; it does
not reopen gameplay rules, Puzzle boards, scoring, themes, layout, branding, or the
single-Canvas architecture. Core still owns the same deterministic twelve-tick /
200 ms `line-clear` phase and row removal. Presentation may read that phase and the
existing terminal events, but may not delay, advance, or reproduce the simulation.

### Four related profiles

The family is theme-led rather than rainbow-coded by line count. Every profile keeps
the locked cells legible and uses the material/theme accent already attached to the
cleared cells. More lines increase spatial coverage, layer count, and the length of a
quiet tail; they do not increase page brightness or introduce giant text.

1. **Precision Cut / 精准切割** — one restrained centre-out face release, a narrow
   inner cut, and at most a few tiny horizontal chips. It has no board impulse, page
   flash, or post-commit tail.
2. **Dual Resonance / 双层共振** — both rows answer as one event with a short paired
   face pulse and one quiet connecting echo. Its post-commit residue is no longer than
   20 ms and cannot cover the next active piece.
3. **Cascade Fracture / 级联裂解** — three rows resolve bottom-to-top with a bounded
   stagger, slightly stronger face separation, and a sparse mineral-chip field. Its
   low-alpha residue ends within 280 ms of `clear-started`.
4. **TetraMorph / 四线重构** — four rows form the only signature clear: four local
   diagonal glints and a denser but still board-local chip field. The Core-facing
   portion still ends at 200 ms; only a low-alpha, non-blocking afterglow may continue,
   and the complete presentation ends within 420 ms of `clear-started`.

The profile table is pure and clamps only valid counts `1..4`; malformed counts fail
closed and create neither visual nor audio work. Normal-motion core durations are
150/183/200/200 ms. Reduced-motion durations are 100/117/133/133 ms and contain only
simultaneous stationary face brightness. Reduced motion removes fragments, stagger,
travel, and post-commit tails while preserving the 1/2/3/4 brightness/layer hierarchy.

No ordinary profile translates or scales the board, flashes the page/HUD, adds blur or
bloom, creates a DOM cell, or instantiates a Pixi filter. All fragment placement is a
stable presentation-only function of count, row, column, and phase. The renderer uses
one bounded ordinary-tail queue, clears it on restart, Puzzle undo, and destruction,
and never lets it grow beyond four cues. Anchors are not ordinary clear participants
and must never receive a clear face or fragment.

### Mode and conflict policy

- **Classic** uses the canonical profile unchanged.
- **Survival** uses 95% face intensity and 90% chip intensity. Clearable falling stone
  cells may emit the same bounded chips in their own cold mineral material; permanent
  bedrock never fractures as part of an ordinary clear.
- **Mutation** uses 105% face intensity. If the same clear activates an item, generic
  face intensity is reduced to 65%, no generic tail is queued, and the item activation
  keeps visual and audio priority.
- **Puzzle** uses 78% face intensity, no chips or tail, and reduced-motion geometry even
  when full motion is enabled. Completion begins only after Core commits the clear.
- **Bomb** removal is not a generic three-line profile. A batch containing Bomb or any
  other Mutation activation suppresses the generic terminal tail and clear chord;
  Bomb, Mutation activation, Puzzle completion, quad, triple, double, and single form
  that descending priority order.

### Clear-forward procedural audio and supporting mix

The existing AudioContext, effects bus, compressor, master volume, and 16-voice ceiling
remain authoritative. The first T28 audio pass was too quiet and tonally sparse in player
review. The accepted direction is **soft-edged but unmistakable**: keep rounded envelopes,
consonant intervals, and bounded gain, while giving each clear enough onset, harmonic body,
and release to read as the positive resolution of the placement. Presence comes from
layering and duration, not a global volume jump, noise burst, sub-boom, metallic click,
distortion, alarm contour, or combo-driven gain.

- one line: two compact voices form one clean confirmation, approximately 85–120 ms;
- two lines: three voices form one consonant answer with a short 18–22 ms spread;
- three lines: four voices rise in a 20–22 ms cascade and settle without a bass impact;
- four lines: five bounded voices form the sole signature cadence, with a smooth bright
  release ending within 240 ms and no piercing upper partial.

A gameplay batch has one audible resolution hierarchy. Mutation activation remains above
ordinary clear. Otherwise an ordinary clear suppresses the routine hard-drop or lock tap
from the same batch so the positive clear cue cannot be masked. Invalid counts schedule no
oscillator. Repeated movement remains rate-limited; rotation stays one unbent mid-low voice;
hard drop remains one rounded contact; soft drop, pause/resume, countdown, Survival warnings,
bedrock motion, level/finish/game-over, and Mutation activations retain distinct contours but
must be rebalanced against the clearer line-resolution family. No supporting cue may become
sharper, more explosive, or more prominent than a same-frame clear or item activation.

Disable, restart, hidden-state suspend, and destroy retain the existing lifecycle rules;
every scheduled source disconnects through its normal `onended` path. No new AudioContext,
sample asset, background loop, dependency, or persistent voice is introduced.

### Acceptance evidence

Focused tests must prove profile mapping, invalid-count refusal, count-specific normal
and reduced timing, deterministic fragments, anchor exclusion, bounded tail cleanup,
and Mutation/Bomb priority. Audio tests must prove oscillator count, frequencies,
delays, low gain, Mutation suppression, and cleanup. After the last source edit, one
typecheck, one complete suite, one production build, and one source-bound browser pass
must inspect 1/2/3/4 clears in full and reduced motion plus Survival, Mutation/Bomb, and
Puzzle conflict frames. Evidence must retain one Canvas, zero DOM board cells, zero
console/page errors, and no project-owned server or browser residue.

## 2026-08-03 T27-R1 — axis-symmetric board stage and visual-theme system

The gameplay page is now a stage rather than a dashboard. Its visual centre is the
board, not the combined width of a board and one asymmetric dock. Desktop uses equal
left and right instrument columns around one fixed central board column. The board's
centre therefore remains invariant when mode-specific instruments change. The left
rail owns Next; Mutation places its timed-state ledger beneath Next. The right rail
owns the four statistics. Narrow layouts retain the same semantic order while moving
the instruments into a compact band around the board.

Only the board is framed inside the live gameplay field. The arena and play surface
are transparent layout planes. Statistics are four aligned text rows with restrained
rules, not four cards and not one rounded card. Next is a label plus a Pixi-drawn piece
on open space; Pixi does not paint a preview well or rounded preview border for this
surface. Mutation states use item color, a short timer rule, and type hierarchy without
an enclosing status card. This removal does not apply to real controls or modal sheets,
whose visible boundaries remain necessary for affordance, focus, and accessibility.
The open Next forecast uses a larger tetromino scale but never regains a DOM outline,
Canvas backing well, rounded rectangle, shadow, or empty placeholder frame. Right-rail
numeric values use a stronger desktop scale and theme-owned high-contrast value color;
their labels remain subordinate. The `Next` and `异变状态 / Mutation status` headings
share the left rail's horizontal centreline, and the forecast geometry sits directly
beneath its heading rather than preserving the dead vertical centre of the removed card.

Three coherent themes share geometry and semantic roles:

- **Mineral Mist / 雾昼矿物** is the bright alternative. Cool paper-blue space, pale stone
  surfaces, slate ink, teal actions, and a navy well express the established precise
  mineral workshop.
- **Deep Tide / 深潮夜航** is the default composition for a fresh profile. Blue-black
  space, desaturated
  mineral text, teal/blue/violet signals, and a deeper well create night navigation
  without neon bloom, translucent glass cards, or decorative telemetry.
- **Sunstone / 暖砂日晷** is the warm alternative. Bone and sand space, graphite text,
  copper/olive actions, and a charcoal-brown well use etched separators and dry mineral
  contrast rather than gradients, gloss, or nostalgic trade dress.

Every theme defines the complete semantic token set: page, surface, raised surface,
ink, muted ink, structural line, strong edge, board well, action/focus, success/danger,
and four mode accents. Home, Puzzle library, gameplay, Settings, action sheets, results,
and the Canvas board shell consume those semantic roles. Canonical tetromino hues remain
recognisable across themes; renderer well and frame values follow the selected theme so
the Canvas never looks pasted onto the page. The current theme is a persisted UI
preference and may update a mounted runtime presentation, but it never enters Core,
replay hashes, scoring, or saved game state.

Home and Puzzle library are complete theme surfaces rather than bright pages placed on a
themed backdrop. Their page field, primary and raised surfaces, navigation controls,
selection states, preview/detail regions, structural lines, ink, and focus treatment all
resolve through the active semantic tokens. Mode identity colors and tetromino identity
remain recognisable without forcing a light card. The visible Back control uses the same
theme-owned filled action color, foreground, border, hover, and focus treatment as the
Settings control.

Home's wordmark panel uses a single solid field resolved from the active theme. That field
comes from a brighter brand-surface token rather than the near-black board-well token. It has no
radial glow painted into the panel, no gradient, and no split-tone texture. Light belongs
to the wordmark itself: one restrained, static theme-colored halo improves presence
without pulsing, flashing, or reducing contrast; reduced motion removes any entrance
interpolation. Mode tiles use the active theme's surface, edge, ink, and mode accent for
hover and keyboard focus. Pointer hover is transient and clears on pointer exit, while
keyboard focus remains visibly themed without falling back to the generic action blue.

Settings presents the three choices as one labelled, arrow-key navigable theme rail.
No option uses a circle, segmented chip, detached color sample, or checkmark. All options
use the currently active theme's shared control surface; they do not preview three separate
theme palettes inside one Settings page. A visible selected outline, localized
selected-state text, and `aria-pressed` keep selection from depending on hue. Enter activates
the focused option, focus remains visible, and reduced motion removes theme cross-fades.
The Motion choice uses the same filled, theme-owned button construction as Language and
Sound in both states; `Full motion` must never look disabled merely because the reduced-
motion boolean is false. Full motion retains bounded cover fades, value-settle cues,
theme/surface interpolation, and the renderer's short particles and trails. Reduced motion
shows the same informative endpoints without cover interpolation, continuous breathing,
value translation, particles, or trails; deterministic timers and game state remain
unchanged. Changing between the two states must not flash or repaint the entire page as an
intermediate frame.

Pause and Restart are board-cover states, not floating white dialogs. Pause uses the
opening cue's full-board composition with `暂停 / Paused` and `回车继续 / Press Enter to
continue`; Enter is the only resume path. Pressing `P` again and pointer clicks on the
cover do nothing.
Restart uses the same composition with `重新开始 / Restart` and `回车确认，按 R 取消 /
Enter to confirm; R to cancel`; Enter restarts through the normal countdown and R returns
directly to the interrupted run. Escape opens the established leave flow from either
Pause or Restart without resuming the run. Neither cover may hide or clear the external Next forecast. The
top-bar Back and Settings controls remain live above both covers. Invoking either control
keeps gameplay paused and replaces the board-local interruption with the existing leave
or Settings transaction.
Theme names and accessible descriptions are localized; identifiers and storage values
remain stable English keys.

Gameplay interruption remains board-local. Pause is not a white dialog: it reuses the
opening cue's board-cover language, with a large localized Pause label and one quieter
instruction line. Only Enter resumes the same run; pointer input and a repeated `P` are
inert while paused. Restart confirmation uses the same board-cover composition and a
wider, more comfortable text measure than the earlier undersized card. Its dim layer
preserves readable Next content on the left. Next itself is an open Pixi forecast with no
DOM border, outline, Canvas backdrop, preview-well geometry, or neutral host rectangle in
populated, empty, paused, restart, or loading states, and idle Mutation state contains no
placeholder dash or rule.

The mirrored instruments are deliberately larger than the first T27-R1 pass and begin
in the upper portion of the stage rather than floating around its vertical midpoint.
Next gains enough drawing area to read at a glance; statistics use a stronger label/value
scale on the right. A value change may settle upward over roughly 180 ms with opacity,
but may not resize the rail, flash, pulse continuously, or move the centred board.
Reduced motion removes this cue.

The entry cover presents only `3`, `2`, and `1`. It never adds a trailing `开始 / Start`
word or hold. After the `1` beat, the veil and its board-local light treatment leave via
one short opacity transition; the first piece begins falling when that exit completes.
The cover uses a corresponding short entrance rather than appearing as a hard cut.
Its illumination begins with one low-contrast luminous base that visibly fills the complete
board, then adds only broad four-direction edge falloff. It must read as one continuous soft
field rather than four isolated edge lobes or a mostly unlit board; no central circle, ring,
hard hotspot, or single-axis beam may remain visible.
Reduced motion keeps the same timing boundary but removes interpolation. Each digit owns
one stronger, short procedural SFX accent on the runtime AudioContext; the cues remain
volume-controlled and leave no persistent voice.

Mutation's ordinary acceleration ladder now clamps at `0.2` seconds per cell. Ice still
overrides the live display and automatic fall to `1.0` second per cell, and the latched
Supergravity landing rule is unchanged. This Mutation-only floor does not modify Classic's
saved two-handle interval or Survival's independent cadence.

### Inner-page navigation

The application uses the browser History API without a router dependency. Canonical
paths are `/` for Home, `/puzzles` for the Puzzle library, `/play/classic`,
`/play/survival`, `/play/mutation`, and `/play/puzzle/:stablePuzzleId`. Initial render
parses the current path, direct links enter the same canonical React state as visible
controls, and `popstate` restores screen, mode, and selected Puzzle. Invalid modes or
Puzzle IDs replace to `/`. First-entry rules are still a modal gate: confirming pushes
the destination path, cancelling leaves the current path unchanged. Core and replay
state never read URL values.

## 2026-08-03 T27 — personalised Classic pace and restrained feedback

T27 is a bounded post-RC polish slice. It does not add a mode or replace the renderer;
it makes the accepted game easier to personalise and makes time-critical feedback more
legible without increasing visual noise.

### Typography and Home

The wordmark remains the only Playwrite NZ Basic text. Ordinary English interface copy
uses the locally packaged Metal regular face at its real 400 weight with one controlled
optical size adjustment so its compact authored metrics remain as legible as the Chinese
UI without substituting another family. Chinese keeps
Noto Sans SC and numeric/data roles keep Geist Mono, so applying Metal never changes
score digits, timers, dates, keycaps, or board indices. A cadence metric has a stable
two-row rhythm: the complete localized label occupies the first row, then the Geist Mono
value and localized unit share one no-wrap baseline on the second. The unit uses
Metal for English and Noto Sans SC for Chinese at the label's visual weight. Metal is
loaded only at its authored 400 weight; the cascade does not invent a bold face and does
not touch the wordmark or data glyphs. Home removes its positioning line in both
languages and collapses that line from layout. Every
fallback remains local/system-safe for offline Steam packaging.

### Gameplay side rail

The ordinary desktop rail is one vertical instrument stack. One enclosing statistics
surface forms a `4 x 1` reading order; it is explicitly neither a `2 x 2` dashboard nor
four independent cards. Its four rows share one border, radius, background, and shadow,
with only quiet horizontal separators between adjacent rows. The Next module follows
immediately below at the same width and surface rhythm. React owns that grouping and
label hierarchy while Pixi remains the sole owner of the actual preview well and piece
drawing. The combined group is vertically centred in the available rail height, so
changing the Next frame cannot strand a large structural gap above or below it. Puzzle
preserves its two-item preview and active Mutation status may join the stack, but
responsive reflow, paused-state visibility, and the one-canvas boundary remain
unchanged.

Mutation adds one stable state instrument before the shared statistics surface. It is
present in both idle and active play so activating or expiring an item never shifts the
statistics or Next preview. Idle state retains only the instrument heading and empty
reserved body; it shows neither a standby sentence nor a decorative spectrum. The
containing surface keeps the same raised hardware family but receives a restrained cool
violet-grey tint and coordinated border, visibly separating Mutation state from the
neutral statistics and Next modules without becoming a yellow warning card. Idle keeps
only that quiet shell tint. Active Freeze, Supergravity, and multiplier rows remain the
primary cyan, violet, and amber signals inside it. The DOM/source order is status,
statistics, then Next on every viewport, even when compact CSS turns that column into a
horizontal strip. Idle and one active row share one reserved ledger height. On desktop,
the instrument is lower-edge anchored above statistics, so simultaneous rows expand
upward while statistics and Next retain invariant coordinates; the empty state does not
need a tall three-row placeholder to achieve that stability.

### Classic gravity interval

Classic owns two player preferences measured in seconds per cell: the opening speed and
the fastest speed. Each is selectable from `1.0, 0.9, ... 0.1`; a fresh profile uses
`0.8` and `0.1` respectively. The fastest value cannot be numerically greater (slower)
than the opening value. The Core stores both tick counts inside a Classic run so seeded
replay and state hashing include all future-affecting state. Every ten cleared lines
advances one 0.1-second tier until the selected fastest bound. Settings may change the
next-run interval while a run exists, but it cannot mutate that run; the runtime injects
both new values only when it constructs or restarts the next Classic state. Invalid or
stale storage falls back to the `0.8` through `0.1` interval rather than entering Core.
The two bounds share one discrete speed rail running from `1.0` (slower) to `0.1`
(faster). Opening and fastest are named above the rail with their live values, while a
single localized unit and the highlighted interval remove repeated labels. Two handles
remain independently focusable and move in `0.1` steps; pointer selection chooses the
nearest handle. The rail, interval, handles, and focus treatment share the Settings
control blue; browser-default colors are not part of the component. The active thumb
owns the focus ring. Pointer drag, click selection, and keyboard adjustment never place
a rectangular focus outline around the full rail.

Classic ranking has three deliberately broad difficulty grades rather than one board
per possible pair of handles. Convert the opening and fastest tick bounds back to
seconds per cell, take their arithmetic midpoint, and classify that midpoint as
`relaxed` at `0.65` seconds or slower, `standard` from `0.35` through `0.60`, or
`challenge` at `0.30` seconds or faster. Because each bound moves in 0.1-second steps,
the midpoint moves in 0.05-second steps and there is no unclassified gap. The Settings
rail displays the localized grade next to the pending interval so the consequence is
known before the next run.

The v9 Classic record stores `classicDifficulty`, `classicStartingGravityTicks`, and
`classicGravityFloorTicks` with the score. A run is therefore compared only with the
top five rows that used the same derived grade, even if the player changes Settings
before opening the result. Settings and results expose one compact three-choice grade
filter, defaulting to the pending or completed run's grade respectively. The underlying
Classic collection retains at most five rows per grade; Survival and Mutation retain
their existing independent top-five collections. Valid v8 Classic records cannot prove
their historical interval, so migration assigns them to Standard while preserving their
score, line, piece, date, and ordering data. The old key remains readable for rollback
and is never destructively rewritten in place.

### Survival pace feedback

The independent falling-rock accumulator advances seven units for every one simulation
tick and resolves at the unchanged Survival gravity threshold. This gives exactly 7x
ordinary gravity without browser-time fractions. No other rockfall rule changes.
`距离落石 / Until rockfall` shares the bedrock countdown's urgent color and restrained
pulse at its existing piece threshold. The complete card surface performs a quiet,
uniform background breath while the border stays stable; no left inset rail or local
stripe is introduced. Reduced motion keeps the color/state change but removes the
pulse. The visual parity is not a second countdown source.

### Supergravity and entry audio

Supergravity is the one five-second timed Mutation. Re-triggering refreshes it to five
seconds; the currently airborne piece keeps the accepted landing latch if the timer
expires. Its persistent cue is the complete top horizontal boundary moving vertically
with a clearly visible irregular two-frequency tremor. All points share the dominant
up/down displacement, with only a minute local variation so it reads as a gravity
boundary rather than a decorative wave. One low-opacity stationary reference echo makes
the travel legible. The board, active piece, and stack never shake with it. There is no
falling stripe, large icon, screen flash, rain language, or board-wide displacement.
Reduced motion keeps one static compressed top edge and its reference echo. The HUD meter
divides by the five-second maximum while other timed items continue to divide by ten
seconds.

Double and Super Double abandon the fixed upper-right star emblem. Their sustained
language is a shallow upper-field score-glint field: independent amber four-point glints
drift from varied top positions and dissolve before reaching the lower playfield. Each
mark is assembled from a faint outer star, a crisp inner star, and no more than two
detached dust motes. There is no circular backing disc, connected stem, line tail, comet
trail, or pulsing halo: those shapes resemble hanging lamps, rain, or UI markers instead
of natural light. This keeps the timed state readable without a screen flash or board-wide
tint. The ×4 tier increases count and warmth, not the footprint of any one mark. The
pattern is ambient state feedback, never an input target or score burst, and it remains
behind active/ghost pieces. Reduced motion retains a clearly visible static top-edge glint
field without drifting animation.

The entry countdown uses an original transport-style procedural cue on the
runtime-owned effects bus. `3` and `2` repeat one short electronic pulse built from a
warm sine body and a very quiet octave partial. `1` repeats that same material at a
clearly higher pitch with an approximately 240 ms body so the final beat reads as a
deliberate countdown resolution; it does not carry a separate quiet envelope
through the remaining hold. The cover then exits silently in 120 ms and input opens. There is no
second onset at the visual boundary: the runtime's `started` event is silent. The three
discrete beats remain rhythmically legible without a detached release sound, pitch
sweep, chord, noise burst, external sample, unrelated Start jingle, extra timer, or
persistent voice. The pulses respect mute and volume, share the runtime AudioContext,
and are released by the existing teardown boundary. Pause/resume cover feedback uses
separate low-gain, short sine taps without sharp pitch sweeps so these interruptions stay
softer than the entry countdown.
Confirming a restart must not layer the generic `restarted` event cue underneath digit
`3`: every restart path hands audible ownership to this one countdown sequence, so its
first beat is exactly one pulse rather than a restart flourish plus a countdown pulse.

Puzzle is the sole entry exception. Because a Puzzle run begins from an authored,
deterministic board and fixed queue, opening, replaying, or restarting it skips the
entry veil, its `3 / 2 / 1` audio, and the veil-exit delay. React enables input and
starts the first fixed piece as soon as the runtime mounts or resets. Classic,
Survival, and Mutation keep the shared countdown; Survival also keeps its staged
bedrock-rise presentation.

Fast horizontal repeat uses one separate soft sine voice with no frequency sweep and a
minimum 60 ms accepted-voice interval. The interval suppresses stacked attacks rather
than delaying input or creating a queued audio stream; gameplay timing remains wholly
unchanged. The movement voice is intentionally quieter than landing, clearing, and
countdown feedback.

Rotation uses one short mid-low sine voice with no second partial and no pitch sweep.
It remains distinguishable from horizontal movement through register and duration, but
must not produce the sharp two-voice chirp of the former triangle-plus-sine cue.

Landing uses a compact mid-low sine contact rather than a bass-heavy impact. A gravity
lock is the quietest form; a hard drop is only modestly stronger and still owns one
short voice. Neither path stacks a second transient, sweeps into sub-bass, or lingers
long enough to read as a thud or electrical tone. Line clears remain the stronger
resolution event.

The Settings sheet does not repeat its page name as a visible top-left heading. Its
dialog keeps the same programmatic name through a visually hidden heading, preserving
screen-reader and focus semantics. Deep Tide Settings tabs use the theme's raised and
action surfaces with near-white text for a clear idle/selected hierarchy. Restart from
Settings is a direct command: it closes the sheet, resets the runtime, and starts a new
countdown. The board-level R shortcut remains the deliberate confirmation flow.

Reshape is an instantaneous Mutation and therefore does not occupy the persistent timed
status ledger. Its activation instead owns a concise three-beat Pixi cue: four displaced
cell facets gather, lock into an I silhouette, and release one restrained confirmation
ripple. A very low-opacity teal field response and corner alignment marks make the event
legible against a busy stack without becoming a full-screen flash. Reduced motion renders
the assembled I plus a static confirmation frame. The cue uses Reshape's teal palette,
never Double's star language, and completes quickly enough to preserve input cadence.

Mutation carriers return to the pre-plate, pre-charm material language. The underlying
tetromino keeps its ordinary body, while every one of its four cells receives the same
fine item-specific surface mark and the connected carrier receives one compact core plus
a restrained perimeter accent. There is no neutral key plate, crate frame, detached
socket, or single-cell charm implying that only one mino owns the item. The same material
language is rendered on the falling piece, locked carrier, and Next preview. All four
cells retain one carrier identity: clearing any one triggers the item, removes that
identity from every surviving sibling, and emits one activation only. Reduced motion
keeps the marks static; clearing or replacing the carrier removes every overlay.

### Portrait result hierarchy

The ranked Classic, Survival, and Mutation result sheet becomes a narrow vertical game
scorecard instead of a wide dashboard. Its desktop measure is `30–32rem`. The sheet
title is the principal ranking metric itself—`消行 / Lines`, `生存时间 / Survival time`,
or `得分 / Score`—rather than `经典结果`, `生存结果`, `异变结果`, or their English
equivalents. The same metric's unboxed hero number follows directly, framed only by
restrained mode color and whitespace, so the label is not duplicated beneath it. The
number keeps the complete Geist Mono glyph box: its container remains overflow-visible,
uses a safe line box, and does not tighten tracking enough to clip counters, terminals,
or the baseline. The contextual metric is one compact supporting row; the top-five
history reads down a
low-noise list; and the actions finish the same axis. A giant bordered hero card and a
second dashboard card are explicitly excluded. Width may collapse to the viewport but
does not expand to fill board space. The current run is still identified inside its
real list row; no duplicate rank sentence, decorative subtitle, or empty side column
is introduced.

Puzzle uses the same portrait rhythm without becoming a ranked-mode ledger. Its title
continues to communicate the actual outcome: first clear, new personal record, or solved
replay. The outcome title leads directly into one central best-step number with the
localized `当前最优步数 / Current best` label and step unit. No emblem, prism, orbiting
particle, or other decorative figure may sit between the title and that number; the
former constellation card, generic completion statistics, level metadata, and
explanatory paragraph are absent.

## 2026-08-03 T26 — v1.0 Release Candidate convergence

TetraMorph now follows a release-candidate convergence programme rather than another
feature cycle. The accepted deterministic Core, single Pixi canvas, four modes, local
audio, replay model, and React composition remain authoritative. Product work is split
into project cleanup, first experience, visual unification, bounded mode polish,
engineering closure, and showcase evidence. Each phase produces a green rollback point.

Phase A separates identity from compatibility. Public metadata, README, active QA
surfaces, and all new persistence writes use `TetraMorph` / `tetramorph`. Historical
`qingliu:*`, `tetris:*`, and `stack-order:*` storage keys remain named migration inputs;
they are not user-facing brand and must not be bulk-deleted. A valid old value is parsed,
written once under the current `tetramorph:*` key, and left intact for rollback.

**Verified Phase-A implementation.** Package metadata and the public README now lead
with TetraMorph. Current rule-intro, leaderboard, and Puzzle-progress writes use
`tetramorph:*`; every former key remains a tested migration input. Maintained runtime
and layout automation now use explicitly branded TetraMorph QA globals. The complete
nonvisual gate passes without starting a development server or browser.

The final typography contract intentionally supersedes T24/T25 experimentation:
Playwrite NZ Basic is the brand face, Space Grotesk is the English/UI face, Geist Mono
is the data face, and Noto Sans SC is the Chinese face. That change belongs to
Phase C and must not be mixed into Phase A.

### Phase B — one-sentence promise, concise rules, immediate Start

The Home keeps its existing four-mode matrix and single `TetraMorph` wordmark. A single
positioning line sits with that brand, never inside the mode cards and never expands
into marketing prose: `Transform the way blocks fall.` in English and
`重新定义下落方块` in Chinese.

First-entry guidance is a separate information layer from Settings. Every mode uses
exactly three facts—Goal / Mechanic / Challenge—written for a first run; Settings keeps
the complete operational rules. The Chinese values for each mode total fewer than 100
characters. This separation prevents a concise onboarding edit from deleting precise
rules players may revisit later.

The entry overlay presents `3`, `2`, `1`, `Start`. `Start` is a short visual handoff,
not another countdown second: the runtime and controls enable at the same boundary at
which the former overlay disappeared. The cue ignores pointer input, clears on every
restart or mode reset, and honors reduced motion without changing deterministic time.

**Verified Phase-B implementation.** Product source `2198b92` keeps one wordmark and
one positioning line, separates three concise first-entry facts from the complete
Settings rules, and makes the final Start cue visually authoritative without adding a
fourth blocking interval. Source-bound evidence `96b8854` proves the desktop, narrow,
short-landscape, and reduced-motion compositions; the Start frame already owns the
single gameplay Canvas and populated Next forecast. No Core, renderer, persistence,
Puzzle ordering, ranking, or mode mechanic changed.

### Phase C — semantic type, progressive Settings disclosure, and responsive presentation

The player-facing type system now has four non-overlapping roles. Playwrite NZ Basic
belongs only to the `TetraMorph` wordmark. Space Grotesk owns ordinary English UI and
must keep translated prose within the same measured regions as Chinese. Noto Sans SC
owns Chinese UI and headings without a separate novelty display face. Geist Mono owns
numeric/data content, keycaps, ranks, dates, percentages, countdowns, and compact units;
its open counters and balanced width must remain readable at HUD size without the
rejected narrow technical tone. A player-facing English selector resolving to
Playwrite, or a data selector resolving to JetBrains Mono / IBM Plex Mono, is a
regression.

Settings is no longer a poster containing four simultaneous sections. The enclosing
sheet owns one compact tab rail and one content viewport:

- **Settings** presents language, SFX, volume, one reduced-motion preference, and the
  restart/continue pair;
- **Controls** presents gameplay controls first, global shortcuts second, and one
  compact visible touch-gesture note beneath those keyboard groups;
- **Rules** presents the current mode's concise rule facts followed by its Puzzle best
  record or non-Puzzle top-five table.

Only the active panel is in the document layout. This is progressive disclosure, not
three nested cards: tab color and a single lower rule identify state, while the content
uses one connected surface and consistent vertical rhythm. Arrow Left/Right changes
tabs; Arrow Up/Down moves between rows inside a panel; Enter activates the focused
control. Desktop, portrait, and 844 x 390 must have no collision, clipped copy,
unintentional two-line action, or empty quadrant retained for content on another tab.

Reduced motion is a player preference with an operating-system default. With no saved
choice, the app follows `prefers-reduced-motion` and continues to react to later system
changes. The first explicit player toggle writes `tetramorph:reduced-motion:v1` as
`on` or `off`; that choice then owns both CSS presentation and the existing Pixi
`setReducedMotion` path. It never changes countdown, gravity, scoring, replay, or any
other deterministic timing. The Controls touch note reuses the actual board gesture
contract—tap to rotate, horizontal swipe to move, short downward swipe to soft-drop,
and long downward swipe to hard-drop—and does not create a second control surface.

Pause interrupts the game surface below the 64 px top bar. Its translucent backdrop
must not participate in hit testing over the header, so Back and Settings remain real
pointer targets as well as members of the focus loop. A chosen top action replaces the
pause sheet rather than stacking another modal; the live board and Next remain mounted,
dimmed, and unchanged.

**Verified implementation.** Frozen typography source `310d83a` implements the four
semantic font roles and the three-panel Settings console without changing gameplay.
Range-based browser geometry checks cover English and Chinese desktop Settings, English
portrait Controls, short-landscape Rules, Home, Pause, and an English Mutation HUD.
Every state has zero clipped text, text-ink overlap, wrong English/data face, or
horizontal overflow. Pause hit testing and real navigation both reach Back and Settings;
the inspected frame preserves a visible Next well beside the compact pause sheet.

The completed Phase-C candidate extends that correction without changing Core rules.
An explicit reduced-motion choice persists as `tetramorph:reduced-motion:v1 = on|off`,
while an unset preference continues to follow live operating-system media changes. The
same resolved value drives CSS and the existing Pixi option. Controls adds one concise
gesture line after gameplay-first and shortcuts-second keyboard groups. Renderer-owned
HUD previews synchronize the Pixi screen to the current host before every geometry read,
so returning from portrait or short-landscape Settings cannot leave a desktop Next well
outside a stale backing buffer. Source `06bd8b9` and evidence `a062799` close Phase C
across current English/Chinese HUD, result, leaderboard, Settings, Pause, and Leave
surfaces with one Canvas and clean teardown.

### Phase D — deterministic Survival warning lead

The existing Survival source-column arrow remains the only visual danger primitive,
but its warning is now a deterministic gameplay-time contract rather than an assumed
by-product of how long the player considers the preceding piece. The warning owns
exactly `48` minimum playing ticks, equal to `800 ms` at the canonical 60 Hz. Those
ticks begin with the single `survival-stones-warned` event. If the player hard-drops
the warned piece immediately, the following entry phase holds only until the remaining
warning ticks reach zero; if ordinary play already consumed the interval, the usual
entry delay is unchanged. Pause consumes no warning time and restart clears the timer.

The timing floor does not redraw the plan or perturb the ordinary seven-bag or Survival
stone randomizer. The frozen source column, one-or-two-cell rigid stone body, interval
progression, four-times fall cadence, blocked-entry deferral, and shared following-spawn
beat remain unchanged. Audio adds one dry, short, rising warning chirp at event time;
it has no loop or expiry voice and cannot mask piece, clear, or rock-impact feedback.

Accepted source `fcabe49` and evidence `c83b156` close Phase D. The evidence uses only
public commands and deterministic seeds, proves the Survival lead at ticks 47/48,
captures every Mutation family at Next/carrier/activation, and synchronizes the Bomb
board export to its actual impact phase. Classic and Puzzle remain presentation audits,
not new systems. Current English typography, numeric data, Settings tabs, Pause/Leave,
live Next wells, responsive fit, and teardown all remain green; final typecheck, the
complete suite (`316 passed / 3 skipped`), and the 768-module build pass. Bundle and
font weight are intentionally deferred to Phase E rather than disguised by thresholds.

### Phase E — measured delivery and idempotent teardown

Production typography keeps the accepted semantic roles but ships only the explicitly
used WOFF2 faces. The Chromium/Steam release target does not require duplicate WOFF
payloads, and historical unused font binaries are not production assets. This is a
delivery correction, not another typography redesign.

Runtime teardown is idempotent by contract. Restart replaces one active runtime with
one active runtime; unmount releases renderer frames, visibility/input listeners, the
single Canvas, QA bridge, and the runtime-owned AudioContext exactly once. Development
tooling may retain its own baseline interval and listeners, so evidence compares the
post-unmount state with the measured pre-runtime baseline rather than claiming an
impossible process-wide zero.

The current main application chunk warning remains visible. The measured payload is
dominated by React DOM, Pixi/runtime rendering, application composition, deterministic
Core, and authored Puzzle data. Raising the warning limit would hide evidence, while
static vendor chunk reshuffling would change request boundaries without reducing first
run execution weight. A lazy runtime boundary is deferred until it can be justified and
verified as a behavior-preserving product change.

**Verified implementation.** Source `4d37d59` reduces emitted font bytes by `57.6%` and
source `6af5403` adds direct idempotent runtime/audio teardown proof. Final typecheck,
the complete suite (`318 passed / 3 skipped`), build, scoped dependency audit, and
source-bound lifecycle browser evidence pass without changing gameplay or presentation.

## 2026-08-03 T25 — language-invariant English mode names

The four Home mode names are permanent English proper names, so their typography is
also permanent. `Classic`, `Survival`, `Mutation`, and `Puzzle` use the existing
Playwrite NZ Basic English UI role whether the surrounding interface language is
`zh-CN` or `en`. The selected language still owns accessible action copy and every
other localized surface. This correction changes no wording, card geometry, mode
order, focus behavior, or animation.

**Verified implementation.** The authoritative Home navigation rule owns the English
family explicitly instead of inheriting the page-language `--font-ui` alias. Chromium
reports the same loaded family, weight, width, height, and position for all four labels
in both language states.

## 2026-08-02 T24 — editorial settings console and stable type roles

**Accepted implementation.** Product/evidence candidate `eeb7c00` preserves one
Playwrite English UI role, one IBM Plex Mono data role, a balanced responsive Settings
console, and a non-modal Pause status window whose focus cycle explicitly includes
Continue, Back, and Settings. The reproducible evidence matrix binds to source
`1dabee8`; independent QA reports no P0-P3 finding.

T24 treats localization as layout truth rather than a string swap. English interface
copy has one consistent handwritten-humanist voice, but it is allowed real line height,
ordinary letter spacing, and content-width columns instead of being squeezed into the
metrics of the former condensed face. The wordmark alone retains the bold outlined brand
treatment. Data moves from the programmer-coded appearance of Fira Code to IBM Plex Mono:
clearer open counters, less aggressive punctuation, real tabular alignment, and no forced
slashed zeroes.

Settings is one editorial console. The top rule strip establishes context; the middle
is a balanced two-column composition with run controls on the left and the complete
keyboard map on the right; the record ledger forms the shared baseline below. Section
color and heading rhythm distinguish content without nested cards or ornamental boxes.
At narrow widths the columns collapse in reading order without retaining desktop-sized
empty tracks.

The pause sheet interrupts the board, not global navigation. Its translucent gameplay
backdrop and compact board-centred surface remain, while the top bar sits on a deliberate
interaction plane above it. Back and Settings can therefore replace Pause with their
existing single-dialog flows. Focus, input disablement, Next visibility, and one-Canvas
ownership do not change.

## 2026-08-02 T23 — authored pressure and quiet transformation

T23 adds decisions, not ambient randomness. Survival receives a slight five-percent
gravity increase and a deterministic Aftershock cadence: every fourth natural wall
rise advances two rows. Because the risk follows the same visible pressure clock and
does not depend on another random stream, players can plan around it. Initial staged
bedrock is presentation setup rather than pressure history; cleared bedrock does not
erase the cave's accumulated cycle. The ordinary rise label changes to Aftershock
only when the next resolved rise will be doubled.

Mutation's fifth carrier is **Reshape**. Its reward is forward information: clearing
the carrier rewrites the first queue entry that remains after the same-transition
spawn to `I`, and the existing Canvas-owned Next well immediately shows that result
for one complete turn before it enters. Reshape is an instantaneous emerald event with a
compact four-cell alignment motif. It never opens a persistent status card or field,
and it cannot disturb Bomb-first resolution, seeded replay, carrier cleanup, or the
fixed queue/preview contract.

Persistent effects recede behind play. Supergravity uses several broad horizontal
compression contours and a shallow contact-pressure wedge around occupied columns;
it contains no narrow vertical rain strokes and never pulses opacity. Multiplier uses
a small upper-corner constellation and x2/x4 mark rather than a central seal. Its
geometry and opacity are time-invariant, and x4 adds only one tiny secondary point.
The status rail remains the strongest source of effect name and remaining time.

Language selection is a run-level setting, so the one persisted control returns to
the Settings console. Home uses four permanent English proper names—Classic,
Survival, Mutation, Puzzle—while actions, rules, Settings, records, and accessibility
continue to localize. The wordmark and mode matrix remain centered and gain no second
language control.

Accepted source `4c43619` and browser evidence `e8418d5` close this contract. Final
typecheck, the full suite (`305 passed / 3 skipped`), and the 762-module build pass.
The evidence resolves the fourth rise from six to eight rows, captures Reshape plus
activation-free Supergravity and Multiplier fields, and reports one Canvas, zero DOM
board cells, zero console errors, responsive fit, and complete cleanup. Independent
read-only QA of `0107e52..e8418d5` reports P0-P3 all zero.

## 2026-08-02 T22 — label-free control and unified English face

The Home language selector is self-evident from its two explicit choices. It displays
only `中文` and `English`; the redundant visible `语言 / Language` prefix is removed.
The control and its button group retain localized accessible names, persisted state,
keyboard focus and navigation, and the established quiet bottom-right placement.
No spacing placeholder replaces the removed label.

English interface copy shares the Playwrite NZ Basic family with the TetraMorph
wordmark so the English surface has one authored voice. The wordmark remains the sole
bold expression through its existing maximum shipped weight and restrained outline;
other English prose uses the family without synthetic bolding. Chinese typography and
the dedicated tabular numeric/data face remain unchanged for legibility.

## 2026-08-02 T21 — relief continuity and modal sightlines

The Survival floor keeps the exact flat collision top and one uninterrupted cave-wall
body. Its new relief is neither a photograph nor a polygon mosaic. A deterministic,
low-frequency height field forms connected folds and mineral bands at several medium
scales; the bands cross both logical axes, receive one restrained upper-left light,
and use a compact cold blue-grey ramp. Neighboring values blend enough to read as one
eroded face, while gentle quantization keeps the surface compatible with the game's
graphic enamel pieces. No individual region may dominate the wall as a giant triangle
or reveal row, column, brick, tile, or wood cadence. The contact lip stays narrow and
integrated rather than becoming a separate platform.

The rockfall warning is deliberately singular. The one downward source-column arrow
is the only animated warning primitive. Normal motion changes that arrow's opacity on
a short rhythm; no board fill, column fill, halo, scan, or global brightness change
participates. Reduced motion shows the same arrow steadily at maximum clarity. The
warning cannot alter the legibility of pieces, Ghost cells, stack, Next, or geology.

Pause and restart confirmation are gameplay-local interruptions. On a desktop game
surface their compact sheet is centred on the board track, leaving the entire right
information rail—including the Canvas-owned Next piece—outside the opaque sheet.
The dimmer may subordinate the scene but must not clear, replace, or cover the preview.
On a narrow layout the sheet returns to the established bottom placement so the top
information band remains readable. Focus trapping, Left/Right selection, Enter,
Escape/cancel, and restoration to the same Canvas remain unchanged.

T21 changes no Core state, queue, preview semantics, stone cadence, collision, scoring,
replay, persistence, mode layout, or result behavior.

### Mutation activation order and supergravity weight

A simultaneous item grant is one causal sequence rather than a pile of unrelated
flashes. Bomb owns the first beat: its irregular localized blast begins before any
subsequent Ice, Supergravity, or Multiplier activation cue and before their changed
presentation can imply that the board settled by itself. Remaining distinct items then
enter in deterministic order with shorter, non-overlapping activation beats. Repeated
grants of one item still refresh its state once and do not replay duplicate cues.

Supergravity communicates sustained mass through downward compression, not an emblem
or screen pulse. A compact field of constant-alpha acceleration traces converges toward
the live stack and a restrained pressure band hugs the occupied region; trace motion
may be brisk, but opacity remains stable. The active piece and independently settled
Ghost stay the strongest geometry. Timer expiry continues to leave an already-airborne
latched piece under Supergravity through its next lock.

Gameplay sheets preserve queue context as a complete visual instrument: both the Next
well and its queued tetromino remain visible. The overlay may lower contrast uniformly,
but it cannot clear, cover, or replace the preview. This exception is scoped to pause,
restart, and leave sheets; the clean pre-run countdown continues to hide Next content.

### Piece-count stonefall, home language, and explicit rules

Survival pressure is now coupled to player decisions rather than wall-clock waiting.
The counter measures locked player tetrominoes until the next rockfall: 8 pieces at the
start, then one fewer after every four rockfall events, bottoming out at 4. The event is
scheduled on the following spawn so the player can read one coherent arrival beat. Its
one- or two-rock column is drawn deterministically from columns outside the new active
piece footprint; the rocks remain independent actors after entry. Their first frame is
already wholly visible at the board top, including both cells of a two-rock body—no
stone may enter through or be clipped by the hidden spawn buffer. The HUD shows the
compact pair `距离落石` / `X块`, never a seconds countdown.

Language selection is a global front-door preference, so its single control lives on
the home composition rather than inside a live run's Settings hierarchy. It remains
visually secondary to the mode grid and wordmark, supports keyboard focus, and persists
the existing preference. Settings keeps rules, audio, controls, keyboard help, and
records without duplicating language state.

Every mode rule sheet uses the same four-part information order: objective, escalating
pressure, mode-specific mechanic, end condition. Classic explains ten-line speed
tiers; Survival explains rising bedrock, piece-count rockfalls, and top-out; Mutation
explains six-line speed tiers and all carrier effects; Puzzle explains authored fixed
queues, original-block clearing, anchors, Undo, and progression. Copy is compact, but
no rule depends on inference from the HUD.

## 2026-08-01 T20 — Survival material harmony correction

The Survival floor is still an exposed cavern wall, but its visual truth is judged
inside TetraMorph's own material system. The rejected height-field looked like a
high-frequency grayscale photograph placed beneath clean enamel pieces. More literal
surface detail made the wall less believable in this game.

The replacement is **stylized mineral relief**. One deterministic, renderer-cached
surface uses broad low-frequency masses, a limited cold blue-grey tonal ramp, and one
restrained upper-left light direction. Regions span multiple cells and never reveal
the occupancy grid. Their sources have no row or column cadence, and neighbouring
planes blend without outlines, brick joints, or a closed repeated tile pattern. Tonal
transitions may be softly stepped to retain the game's graphic material language, but
the surface cannot regain photographic microtexture, neutral monochrome noise, pebble
detail, camouflage, or hard contour rings. The exact collision top remains level, and
a narrow integrated lip may clarify contact without becoming a separate platform bar.
The lower wall deepens gently so it retains weight beside the brighter playable palette.

The rockfall pre-warning is a signal layer, not geology. A warm accent distinguishes it
from the cold stone family and from every Mutation item. The source column retains a
single downward arrow with a longer shaft and clearer head. During normal motion the
arrow, a narrow column wash, and a very restrained whole-well wash share one short
rhythmic pulse; the board content stays readable and there is no sustained strobe after
the Core warning state ends. Reduced motion renders the maximum-clarity static endpoint
with no time-based opacity change.

This correction does not alter stone count, frozen source column, 4x cadence,
temporary-obstruction rules, coupled push, bedrock rise, scoring, replay, or save data.
The procedural texture still allocates once per renderer and is destroyed on teardown.

**Accepted implementation (2026-08-01).** Frozen source `eadeac6` realizes the wall
with deterministic Halton-distributed broad planes, a seven-step cold mineral ramp,
soft neighbour blending, and a shallow flat contact lip. Its normal-motion warning
keeps the arrow readable between short high-contrast warm flashes; reduced motion is
one static endpoint. Evidence `b600ace` proves the complete live Survival page and
browser invariants. After the sole writer-log provenance gap was repaired by `534e78e`,
independent QA `1b0c64c` accepted P0–P3 and evidence gaps at zero.

## 2026-08-01 Phase 12 — material truth and authored learning

Phase 12 responds to direct visual rejection by making fewer claims and making each
claim physically legible. A stone is defined by silhouette, face planes, contact, and
motion—not a crack decal. A section is defined by typography and reading order—not a
card around every paragraph. A Puzzle hint is defined by a reusable idea demonstrated
by a real level—not a dashboard of solver counts.

The accepted procedural bedrock wall is immutable during the final responsive retry.
That retry fixes measured Puzzle-title glyph clipping and the short-landscape Settings
footer, then replaces the browser matrix with active Mutation and dynamic Survival
proof. It may not revise the wall texture, flat contact lip, geology palette, falling
stone geometry, or Core behavior.

### Decision surfaces

The leave sheet presents the requested destination as the clear default: the left
`返回首页 / Back to home` action is filled primary blue and initially focused. The right
`留在本局 / Stay in this run` action is a quiet pale secondary. Color, position, focus,
and Enter therefore agree instead of sending contradictory signals.

Settings is one bounded console. The enclosing sheet owns the background, border,
radius, and shadow. Rules, Controls, Keyboard, and Record are ordinary flow sections
inside it; none may paint its own card background, rounded container, top stripe, or
shadow. Their headings establish hierarchy through Barlow/Chinese display weight,
section-specific text color, and consistent label rhythm. Space separates ideas but
does not reserve empty columns.

### Typography

- `TetraMorph`: Playwrite NZ Basic, unchanged and used nowhere else.
- English interface: Barlow Semi Condensed at locally bundled static weights. Its
  humanist industrial proportions give controls and mode names a distinct voice while
  fitting narrow surfaces without artificial condensation.
- Data and controls: Fira Code Variable for times, scores, ranks, dates, keycaps, and
  board numerals. Tabular figures and stable punctuation replace Geist Mono.
- Chinese families remain the accepted local UI/display files. Font fallback is
  explicit; no runtime font request is allowed.

Text containers are content-safe rather than ellipsis-driven. Values such as
`0.5 s/cell` remain whole. Responsive changes may reflow a stat grid or reduce a
heading size within its token range, but may not clip units, split an action into an
accidental two-line button, or hide a translated label.

### Survival material system

Bedrock is a continuous vertical cave wall with a mathematically flat top contact at the
cell boundary. Three rejected readings are forbidden: a plain framed slab with a few
oversized light planes, a low-poly fan of triangles/trapezoids, and a dry-stacked masonry
wall made from visible courses and dark joints. The wall owns one uninterrupted body,
then receives a deterministic multi-scale relief field whose irregular mineral regions
cross both row and column boundaries. Regions use close-valued slate tones and shared
edges without mortar-like outlines; broad vertical weight and gradual depth darkening
make the surface read as an exposed cavern face rather than a platform or built wall.
That relief must remain legible at the ordinary gameplay scale. A deterministic
renderer-lifetime height field combines low-frequency eroded masses with restrained
finer grain; a fixed upper-left light derives highlights and occlusion from that same
surface instead of drawing symbols or seams. Rounded nested blobs, pebble clusters,
cobblestone, repeated zigzags, camouflage, and folded-paper reads are forbidden
alongside a nearly uniform low-contrast slab and a sharp tessellated mosaic. The texture
is generated locally once, reused, and destroyed with the renderer; it does not add a
visible canvas, network asset, per-frame random work, or Core state.
No region may repeat at cell cadence, reveal a `10 × N` grid, form horizontal courses,
or dominate the wall as one giant geometric facet. The contact plane keeps one narrow,
restrained mineral lift while the exterior sides and bottom are clipped by the board,
not framed. The rock read comes from continuous surface relief, scale variation, and
directional light—not from a crack, chip, pit, speckle, sticker, stroked vein, wood
grain, brick joint, or per-cell texture. The mass can rise during entry without changing
Core rows.

A falling stone is an unmistakable square block whose rendered outer width and height
equal one ordinary board cell. A narrow bevel and two solid tonal faces create volume
without changing that exact collision-sized silhouette. One event contains one or two
vertically adjacent squares in one frozen column; a pair has no seam-sized gap and
moves and settles as one rigid component. The event advances with an integer accumulator
at four times ordinary Survival gravity. The warned column is identified by one fixed
downward arrow before the event; there is no fissure, flashing beacon, or alternative
warning emblem. An in-flight stone is a temporary obstruction, not a floor: contact
cannot enter or exhaust ordinary lock delay or trigger top-out. When its attempted next
row is occupied only by the active piece, Core treats the pair as one atomic debris
step: both stone and active piece translate down exactly one row if both destinations
are legal against settled board and every other debris event. This repeats at debris
cadence while the stone remains above the piece. If the active piece is instead above
the stone, the stone is temporary dynamic support only: the piece stays where it is
while the faster stone falls away when legal. Neither ordering consumes ordinary
gravity or lock delay, and illegal paired movement leaves both bodies waiting. Player
lateral movement can clear the relation; normal gravity resumes once the stone is no
longer above or below the piece. Normal lock delay resumes only after support is settled
board. Only cadence, this explicit temporary-coupling boundary, warning language, and
material presentation change.

### Home action geometry

The four mode tiles communicate their destination through the mode name and icon. Their
actions therefore use one square arrow control without the redundant `开始 / Start` or
`选关 / Levels` caption. The arrow glyph is centred by button geometry rather than a
font-baseline nudge, and its horizontal shaft is visibly longer than the rejected
compact mark without widening the square target. All four arrows share the same shaft,
head, stroke, and optical centre, while the complete localized mode action remains
available to the accessible name. Hover, focus, and keyboard selection may strengthen
the tile's own color but may not displace the arrow.

### Mutation duration audio

Multiplier and Super multiplier communicate their ten-second duration through the
status rail, light treatment, and countdown. Audio is event-based only: one brief cue
may acknowledge acquisition or activation, but no loop, drone, pulse, or repeated
state sound continues while either multiplier remains active.

The multiplier's ambient emblem is a compact local seal, not a full-board signal. Its
geometry stays small enough to preserve stack readability and its active-state alpha is
steady: no screen flash, alternating opacity, or bright/dark field pulse. Super
multiplier strengthens detail and value inside the same bounded footprint. Reduced
motion uses that same static endpoint.

Supergravity uses the same no-flash discipline, but no longer draws a board-wide top
boundary or ambient field. Weight follows the airborne piece itself: each visible cell
casts a short violet afterimage and tapered upward trail, so downward acceleration is
read from the moving form rather than from unrelated screen decoration. The trail is
clipped to the well, stays behind the solid piece, and disappears on lock without
leaving an empty cell frame. Reduced motion keeps one quiet, static short-tail endpoint.
The effect is latched onto the already-airborne piece: timer expiry changes the HUD and
future spawns, while that piece retains both the trail and independent per-column
settlement through its next lock. The latch is consumed by that lock and cannot leak to
the following piece.

Carrier material is owned only by extant cells. A consumed carrier can seed a bounded
activation burst, but the renderer must not retain or reconstruct its former square
rim, attachment frame, or empty-cell outline after the clear removes it.

### Home identity alignment

The `TetraMorph` wordmark is centred against the complete dark brand panel, not against
an incidental text line box. The layout uses the panel's two-axis grid centre and gives
the script face a symmetric containing box so glyph overhang cannot pull the visible
mark off-centre. The browser icon is a clean 2×2 square of Classic green, Survival blue,
Mutation orange, and Puzzle purple in reading order. It is an original mode-map mark
with no letter, copied logo, or trade-dress silhouette.

Final responsive proof must preserve that same geometry after every legacy cascade.
The wordmark owns a shrink-to-ink box (`max-content`) centred by the parent grid; it may
not inherit a full-width flex box or a compensating translation at portrait or short
landscape widths. The play header follows the same content-safety rule: translated mode
names keep a complete glyph box and visible ascenders/descenders, so a narrow layout may
reduce type size but may not crop Barlow glyphs with `overflow: hidden`.

### Puzzle curriculum

The rejected live analysis panel is removed. It offered counts generated from the
current decision but did not explain why a placement was useful and encouraged trial
and enumeration. The replacement is authored curriculum at the level-selection
boundary, where the player can read one idea before play and then test it without a
live answer feed.

Every lesson-bearing level must have at least one replay-verified public-command route
that demonstrates its idea and one alternate verified route so the lesson does not
imply a single script. The introductory sequence progresses through:

1. close the prepared row before adding unrelated height;
2. preserve a narrow well for the matching long or vertical body;
3. build support before placing a cap that would bury a hole;
4. read Next 1 and 2 as a two-move plan rather than two isolated pieces;
5. flatten one landing surface while retaining a future opening;
6. treat an anchor as permanent collision geometry rather than a target;
7. use a timed side-slip at anchor height to reach around an overhang.

The visible campaign follows that teaching sequence rather than treating route length
as the only definition of difficulty. Stable IDs, boards, seeds, and verified route
families do not move with their old ordinal: the current `difficulty` field is the
teaching position. The library uses three named tabs with deliberately unequal sizes:

- `入门 / Intro` — three isolated three-row foundations;
- `简单 / Easy` — twenty-seven three-row lessons/combinations and four-/five-row
  applications; its first three levels are certified mastery checks, followed by the
  first anchor geometry and timed side-slip lessons;
- `困难 / Hard` — twenty high-load applications grouped by the earlier technique they
  demand, not presented as one undifferentiated endgame wall.

Each Hard group points back to one selected Easy mastery level that exercises the same
idea in a cleaner board. A Hard level unlocks when the saved best for that prerequisite
is no greater than its certified optimum plus five operations. The selector explains
the relationship and remaining threshold in accessible text without turning the page
into a statistics dashboard. Historic save formats keep their literal legacy order
only for decoding; current completion and best-step records remain attached to stable
level IDs when normalized into the revised campaign. A historically completed Hard
level remains replayable even when its newly introduced mastery prerequisite has not
yet been met.

An optimum certificate is stronger than the existing paired route evidence. The
authoring verifier traverses every unique Core decision state that can still finish
before the candidate depth, without beam width, heuristic scoring, state-count cutoff,
or route-length assumption. Its only pruning rule is a mechanically checked admissible
column-conservation bound: every distinct surviving target row still consumes one cell
from every column when it clears; all ordinary cells already in that column are credited
as reusable supply, and only the summed column deficits are divided by four future cells
per tetromino. This stays safe when earlier clears pull existing cells into later target
rows. It records
each exhausted depth, finds no success before depth `N`, then replays public commands
that finish at depth `N`. The frozen
certificate stores the level ID, `N`, replay, frontier widths, explored-state count,
and the current puzzle-definition fingerprint. Product code reads only this verified
constant; verification tests recompute or validate it against the deterministic Core.
The former `shorterRouteLocks` fields remain exactly what they were: shortest routes
found by that bounded search, not mathematical optimality claims.

The library may show a short lesson title and a two-sentence principle/control cue for
the selected introduction level. It may not show landing counts, burden scores,
coordinates, exact rotations, or a complete move stream. Levels without an authored
intro lesson keep the clean preview/name/best/start composition.

### Puzzle header rhythm

The Puzzle library header and the connected gallery are one content-height vertical
composition. The back action and centred wordmark occupy the compact header track; the
gallery follows after a visible but restrained breathing gap: 16 px on desktop and
12 px on portrait or short-landscape layouts. The complete header-plus-gallery stack is
vertically centred in the viewport so that spare height sits outside the composition,
never as either a large disconnect or a visually attached edge between navigation and
the content it controls. This deliberately moves the header down while keeping the
gallery near its established position and size. It does not resize the cards, preview,
tabs, or responsive matrices and must preserve zero overflow at every target viewport.

### Phase 12 acceptance

Phase 12 is accepted at frozen product source
`d84b04351dc89d5f503df2112a71789950ba0796`. Final evidence
`18f8886..9e22a8b` supplies Chinese/English desktop, portrait, short-landscape,
reduced-motion, active Mutation, and dynamic Survival proof with one Canvas, zero DOM
board cells, zero overflow, and zero console/page errors. Strict optimum certificates
pass `3/3`; the final typecheck, full `32 passed / 1 skipped` file suite
(`297 passed / 3 skipped` tests), and `762`-module build pass. Independent read-only
QA `9ec1149..6fce9e6` reports P0–P3 and evidence gaps all zero. The separately
accepted procedural cavern wall chain `2e14ec3 / dcb1d79 / 5619bce / 92a124f`
remains immutable. Publication is non-force and owned resources are released.

## 2026-07-31 Phase 11 — luminous instruments and legible intent

Phase 11 preserves the accepted mineral/cavern foundation but tightens its signal:
**every surface must reveal material, state, or tactical intent.** Ornament that looks
like a rule, border that disappears under selection, and empty space reserved without
information are all treated as defects.

### Material grammar

Ordinary tetrominoes are bright enamel-mineral bodies: a saturated face, a lighter
upper/inner edge, and a stable dark perimeter. The seven hues remain identifiable in
peripheral vision and under Mutation attachments. Brightness rises without a white
glow layer or a second palette.

Survival geology uses dedicated procedural vector bodies rather than the ordinary
cell renderer. Permanent bedrock is a broad continuous basalt shelf: its jagged outer
contour is the geometry, no internal square grid is drawn, and connected lit/shadow
planes plus a few structural fractures establish volume across the mass. Falling
stones are irregular convex boulders with chipped perimeters and distinct lit and
shadow faces. A two-stone event interlocks two bodies into one falling mass instead
of stacking two textured squares. Dust supports motion only; it is never a substitute
for silhouette and volume. Deterministic vertex variants preserve replay and render
tests.

### Mutation atmosphere

- **Ice:** one continuous upper cold front extends through roughly the upper half of
  the well. Opacity follows a smooth easing curve, never visible bands; sparse flecks
  and a faint upper rim establish cold without recoloring the board.
- **Supergravity:** no central icon, chevron badge, flash, top strip, or bottom strip.
  A darkened upper pressure field, a few deterministic downward streaks, and a short
  support-compression response make weight readable. The ghost is a projection of
  the active cells after ordinary descent and the same independent-column settlement
  used by the real lock.
- **Bomb:** no rectangular three-row target frame. A graded lower heat field, an
  irregular blast edge, and rising embers identify the bottom-three-row scope. The
  effect is short, localized, and still understandable with reduced motion.

### Information composition

The right rail is an instrument stack, not a full-height column. It sizes to its
stats/status/Next content; a mode-specific module appears only when it carries useful
information. Settings uses four explicit surfaces in order: Rules, Controls,
Keyboard, Record. Every surface owns its heading and grid so translation length
cannot merge adjacent labels.

English UI is locally packaged Space Grotesk Variable. Numeric and tabular data is
locally packaged Geist Mono Variable. Chinese retains the accepted local UI/display
families and the wordmark alone retains Playwrite NZ Basic. Layout is measured after
`document.fonts.ready`; labels wrap deliberately and values never truncate their
units.

### Puzzle readout

Puzzle guidance is diagnosis rather than instruction. At a decision boundary it
enumerates the same finite legal hard-drop landings already used by route validation,
then publishes four small quantities:

1. **Direct clears:** landings that reduce remaining original cells immediately.
2. **Safe landings:** landings that introduce no buried hole and do not raise the
   non-target burden beyond the best available alternative.
3. **Buried holes:** currently empty cells enclosed below occupied support.
4. **Minimum burden:** the smallest number of extra non-target cells a legal landing
   adds while preserving the puzzle objective.

One prioritized sentence selects among direct clear, hole repair, narrow-gap
preservation, or skyline flattening. The visible queue receives only role hints such
as long-well, flat cap, junction, offset, or edge turn. The system never reveals an
exact column/rotation path, mutates Core, consumes item or piece RNG, changes undo,
or searches continuously with elapsed time.

### Interaction edges

The leave sheet initially selects Back to home. Home cards have no accent rail and
retain a complete inset top edge through hover/focus/selection. Pointer leave removes
pointer highlighting; keyboard focus remains independently visible.

### Phase 11 acceptance

The accepted implementation freezes product source at `12fb0ae` and browser evidence
at `d1656a1`. The geology correction is structural rather than decorative: Survival
bedrock is one continuous, jagged, faceted basalt shelf with no occupancy grid, while
one- and two-stone events use irregular joined boulder geometry instead of textured
square cells. The final Ice correction uses one smooth cached gradient rather than
stacked translucent bands. Final typecheck, `31` files / `288` tests, the `758`-module
build, 24-frame browser review, `26/26` evidence-integrity check, independent QA, and
the scoped secret scan all pass with no product or evidence finding.

## 2026-07-31 Phase 10 — pressure without ambiguity

Phase 10 unifies a set of related defects around one design principle: **the player
must be able to read what will happen next, why it happened, and what mattered in the
finished run.** The accepted Phase-9 mineral/cavern language remains the foundation;
this phase changes state communication, collision semantics, and result hierarchy
without adding ornamental text or another visual system.

### Canonical language

- The gravity tile is `下落速度 / Fall speed`. The numeric value always includes
  `秒/格 / s/cell`; Chinese Ice deliberately shows `1.0 秒/格`.
- The independent-column Mutation effect is `超重 / Supergravity`. Its internal
  serialized identifier may remain `collapse` so existing deterministic state and
  storage do not migrate, but no current player-facing rule, live region, status row,
  Next description, result, or accessibility label says `坍缩 / Collapse`.
- Survival pressure uses the compact tile `上升 / Rise`; the row count remains a
  deterministic game-state fact and may appear in rules or renderer diagnostics, but
  not in the tile heading.

### One cue per Mutation item

Carrier resolution still consumes every carrier and applies every mechanical effect.
For presentation, activations are grouped by item in deterministic first-seen order.
Each item produces one event containing the combined trigger cells and final canonical
duration/factor. A repeated Bomb may still apply its mechanical row clears; a repeated
Double may still promote to ×4; neither produces stacked duplicate flashes or audio
cues. Different item types remain visibly concurrent.

Ice is a local cold front, not a color filter. Its persistent field is a translucent
upper-edge gradient that fades before the main stack, with sparse descending flecks
and a restrained boundary glint. Board, ghost, carrier, and material hues remain
recognizable. Reduced motion uses the same static gradient without drifting particles.
There is no sustained Ice oscillator; activation receives one short, low-gain glass
tap or silence. The HUD reads `1.0 秒/格` for the full active interval and restores
the underlying six-line Mutation cadence when the timer reaches zero.

Supergravity keeps the canonical Next silhouette. On settlement, the affected columns
receive short downward weight marks and a denser support imprint; no row-wide strip,
top banner, displaced preview, screen shake, or geometry mutation is allowed.

### Survival one-way moving support

Falling stones are faster environmental actors, not spawn blockers. Ordinary spawn is
validated against settled board cells only. If a stone already overlaps the spawn
footprint, that overlap is grandfathered only while it resolves downward; the active
piece cannot move farther into a new stone cell.

When an active piece's next downward cells are supported by one falling event and the
event advances, Core attempts one atomic coupled step:

1. move the supporting stone event down one cell;
2. move the active piece down one cell;
3. accept both only when the active candidate does not collide with settled board or
   another non-supporting stone.

If the coupled step is blocked, the falling event waits rather than settling into the
active piece. Once the stone lands on settled support, it becomes ordinary clearable
board material and normal lock delay resumes. The rule is deterministic, integer-step,
hash-visible, and covered for one- and two-stone events, spawn overlap, lateral escape,
coupled descent, blocked descent, clear, and restart.

### Trustworthy preview and entry lifecycle

Next is derived from Core queue plus Mutation item RNG without consuming either. It is
visible during pause and leave/restart confirmation, and hidden only in the canonical
`ready`, `finished`, or `game-over` states. Mutation atmosphere and Supergravity
settlement never crop, recolor away, or replace the preview body.

Restart and Play again both reset into `ready`, disable gameplay input, and run the
same `3 / 2 / 1` presentation gate used for first entry. A restart must not call
`start()` early. On the first `playing` frame, active, ghost, carrier, and Next return
together.

### Mode-first settlement ledger

The result surface answers one question per mode:

- **Classic:** how many lines? Principal value is lines; secondary value is pieces.
  Ranking remains lines-first.
- **Survival:** how long? Principal value is survival time; secondary value is lines.
  Ranking remains elapsed-time-first.
- **Mutation:** how much score? Principal value is score; secondary value is lines.
  Ranking changes to score-first and never shows piece count.

The header uses the mode name plus neutral `结果 / Result` semantics; it never restates
the loss cause. One accent edge, the primary metric, the current leaderboard row, and
the primary action carry the mode color. Date and top-five history remain meaningful.
Unranked copy remains compact. No dot-separated summary sentence or decorative subtitle
is added.

Settings begins with Rules because it explains the current context before controls.
The leave confirmation places Return on the left and Stay on the right; Stay receives
initial focus. This makes visual position match risk while preserving arrow-key and
Enter operation.

### Puzzle completion as one transaction

Puzzle success is not inferred later from a dismissed modal. The finished Core snapshot
is converted immediately into one canonical progress update:

- add the level ID to the completed set;
- compare the operation count with the stored best and retain the lower value;
- persist one versioned snapshot;
- derive unlocks, gallery ticks/name color, hero best, and Settings record from that
  snapshot.

The canonical level ID is resolved from the finished snapshot and the currently mounted
Puzzle only when those identities agree. All fifty gallery entries are selectable in
the current product, so the retired progressive-frontier guard is not a completion
eligibility check: if Core successfully finishes the selected canonical level, that
achievement must be recorded. Invalid, mismatched, or non-Puzzle snapshots still fail
closed.

The update is idempotent, so React Strict Mode, duplicate terminal renders, or returning
before the next paint cannot erase or double-apply it. A completion with no previous
best is `first`; a lower move count is `record`; all other successes are `repeat`.
Storage reload and language change may re-render presentation but never recompute or
discard the achievement.

### Puzzle celebration

Puzzle success keeps a dedicated **violet-accent celebration** rather than sharing the
mode-loss ledger. The modal uses mineral white, a narrow violet-to-teal light edge, one
large success title, and the single meaningful figure `当前最优步数 / Current best`.
First completion says `恭喜你破解谜题 / Puzzle solved`; a new best says
`刷新个人纪录 / New personal best`; a repeat says `谜题已破解 / Puzzle solved`.
No eyebrow, line count, score, generic “run complete,” or duplicate “首次完成” detail
appears. The title flows directly to the best-step figure: no prism emblem,
constellation, or decorative particles appear above it.

Motion is short and bounded to the edge glow settling in `180 ms`; no decorative
fragments are emitted. `prefers-reduced-motion` renders the final edge without a
transition. Focus opens on Replay; Left/Right selects Replay or Back, Enter executes,
Escape returns to the library.

### Survival cave motion and geology

Survival's three countdown beats remain authoritative, but the presentation between
beats is continuous. At digit `3`, the first row translates upward from one row below
the well and eases into its canonical bottom position; digits `2` and `1` repeat the
same bounded motion while the already revealed shelf rises by the same one-cell
distance and the new row enters beneath it. Each beat spends `680 ms` on the rise and
`140 ms` on a restrained settle using `cubic-bezier(.22,.72,.28,1)`, then holds until
the next one-second beat. It never restarts within the same digit, bounces, or shakes
the camera. The digit remains visually stable. Reduced motion reveals each completed
row at its final position with no translation. Core still begins with the same
deterministic three bedrock rows; this is a Renderer mask/offset contract only.

Bedrock and falling stones share one **cold cave geology**:

- base faces are graphite/slate rather than brown, beige, or warm timber;
- every cell has two or three deterministic irregular planes rather than horizontal
  grain or a repeated brick seam;
- cracks are short and oblique, never row-spanning;
- permanent bedrock is darker and visually interlocked into one rising shelf;
- falling stones are one value step brighter, retain a complete readable outline,
  carry one sparse lower-edge dust trail while moving, and show the frozen one/two
  cell event height;
- rock planes, chips, pits, and fractures are derived deterministically and cached;
  they never use per-frame random geometry or enter the hot animation path;
- neither material changes collision geometry, board occupancy, line-clear behavior,
  warning timing, or the single-Canvas boundary.

The final visual proof must include one intermediate row-rise frame, all three completed
countdown beats, a one-stone fall, a two-stone fall, settled rock, and reduced motion.

### Local typography system

The wordmark remains the only use of **Playwrite NZ Basic**. All other text moves to a
language-aware four-role system selected from sources with explicit commercial
embedding permission:

- **Chinese body/UI — 文渊黑体 / WenYuan Sans Variable.** Use variable weights
  `420–720` for rules, controls, buttons, labels, and compact prose. Its mainland
  Chinese forms and broad coverage carry readability.
- **Chinese display — 得意黑 / Smiley Sans.** Use only for short Chinese display
  headings at `28 px` or larger, such as mode and key result titles. Its slanted
  construction must not appear in body copy, buttons, compact Settings headings,
  keyboard maps, numbers, or dense leaderboard rows.
- **English UI — Sora Variable.** Use `420–760`; its large x-height and open counters
  support compact application UI while remaining visually distinct from the wordmark.
- **Numbers — IBM Plex Mono.** Use for countdown digits, HUD values, ranks, timers,
  level numbers, dates, and scores with tabular numerals.

All four families are self-hosted. The build contains their original license notice;
no CDN or runtime request is permitted. CSS selects Chinese roles under
`:lang(zh-CN)` and English roles under `:lang(en)` rather than relying on incidental
fallback order. A missing display glyph falls back to 文渊黑体; a missing English glyph
falls back to Sora/WenYuan in that order. Loading must not change control sizes,
Puzzle-square geometry, result fit, or board alignment after `document.fonts.ready`.

Selection provenance is explicit rather than inferred from a font download:

- 文渊黑体 is the variable OFL family documented by
  [猫啃网](https://www.maoken.com/freefonts/28291.html) and its
  [upstream repository](https://github.com/takushun-wu/WenYuanFonts);
- 得意黑 is the OFL display face documented by
  [猫啃网](https://www.maoken.com/freefonts/17247.html) and
  [atelierAnchor](https://github.com/atelier-anchor/smiley-sans);
- Sora's UI purpose and OFL distribution are documented by its
  [upstream repository](https://github.com/sora-xor/sora-font), while
  [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/fonts/sora/install) supplies the self-hosted
  variable package;
- IBM Plex Mono is distributed under OFL by
  [IBM](https://github.com/IBM/plex/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

Every player-facing `返回模式 / Back to modes` label is replaced by
`返回首页 / Back to home`; historical documentation may retain old copy only as
provenance.

## 2026-07-31 Phase 9 direct re-open — clean entry, result ledger, and Puzzle gallery

The latest real-frame review reopens four presentation-only surfaces after the
navigation cascade repair. Two bounded read-only comparisons were completed before
source work: one traced countdown visibility and compared result-sheet hierarchies;
the other compared two-page Puzzle gallery layouts and transient home selection.
The accepted synthesis below supersedes the earlier Phase-9 `10×5 / 5×10` selector
composition, but does not change Puzzle definitions, order, progress, records, Core
timing, randomisation, or any mode rule.

### Countdown visibility

- `ready` is a pre-play presentation state. Core may retain its deterministic active
  piece and queue, but Renderer must draw and report no active cells, ghost cells,
  carrier overlay, or Next piece until `playing` begins.
- Survival digits `3 / 2 / 1` show only the digit plus exactly `1 / 2 / 3` canonical
  bedrock rows rising into place. The stable empty Next well may remain so the HUD
  does not reflow.
- The first `playing` frame restores active, ghost, carrier, and Next together. The
  gate is `state.status`, never a React timing flag, so no cross-frame leak is
  possible.

### Run-result ledger

- Classic, Survival, and Mutation use one compact **mineral result ledger** rather
  than the generic danger sheet. Mineral white remains the base; the current mode
  color appears only on a narrow top edge, principal values, current-run row, and
  primary action.
- The hierarchy is title and rank, two meaningful metrics, top-five leaderboard,
  then two actions. Dot-separated prose and ornamental subtitles are prohibited.
- Classic shows lines and score. Survival shows survival time and lines; pieces and
  bedrock rows are removed. Mutation shows lines and score. A ranked run does not
  repeat a separate `本局第 N 名 / This run · #N` label: its explicitly marked,
  mode-colored row in the leaderboard is the sole rank treatment. An unranked run
  still says `未进入前 5 / Outside the top 5`.
- Result leaderboard rows retain rank, meaningful mode metrics, date, and an explicit
  current-run mark. Puzzle success keeps its earned celebration surface and is not
  absorbed into the run ledger.
- `src/styles/result.css` is the only new result authority and loads after shared
  HUD/navigation layers. It must preserve two-button Left/Right + Enter behavior,
  Escape return, `44 px` targets, reduced motion, and compact landscape.

### Two-page Puzzle gallery

- The library is a **two-page Puzzle gallery**, not a fifty-cell dashboard. Page one
  contains `01–25`, page two `26–50`; each page is one functional `5×5` matrix with
  no page or panel scrolling.
- Every level node is a true square. The matrix is centered inside the catalogue
  instead of stretching its five rows to consume every available pixel; deliberate
  inter-node gaps keep the twenty-five controls readable rather than compressed into
  a worksheet.
- The connected gallery frame uses the full available row on compact viewports but
  caps at `740 px` on taller screens. The outer frame, not the square controls,
  contracts to remove structural empty space around the preview and matrix. Once
  contracted, it is vertically centered in the available content row so the whole
  selector does not cling to the top edge.
- Desktop and short landscape place a large deep-indigo live board preview on the
  left and the page controls plus matrix on the right. Portrait stacks the same two
  surfaces. The preview, localized level name, current best, and Start action form
  one connected hero surface.
- Puzzle keeps a distinct deep-indigo / restrained violet / warm-anchor language
  while reusing TetraMorph typography, mineral white, focus rings, and radii. Nodes
  show only centered number or completion tick; best count appears only in the hero.
  Hover never translates a first-row control beyond the clipped matrix, and selected
  nodes carry no ornamental corner squares without product meaning.
- The two range controls are a real tablist. Each page uses roving focus with
  Left/Right `±1`, Up/Down `±5`, Home/End, and Enter selection. Crossing `25/26`
  changes page without losing focus. Page change and preview settle within `180 ms`;
  reduced motion switches instantly.
- `src/styles/puzzle-library.css` is the final Puzzle-library authority, imported
  after `navigation.css`. Required frames are `1440×900`, `844×390`, `390×844`,
  and `360×800`, both pages, Chinese/English, selected/completed, longest-best copy,
  keyboard focus, and reduced motion.

### Transient home emphasis

- The initial home frame has zero active cards. Pointer emphasis is expressed only
  by real hover and disappears within one frame of leaving the mode region.
- Roving keyboard position remains independent of pointer hover. Tab/arrow focus
  keeps `:focus-visible`; pointer leave must not erase real keyboard focus.
- The permanent `mode-gate--active` / pressed-selection presentation is removed.
  Enter/click behavior, the two-by-two matrix, one wordmark, and stable font metrics
  remain unchanged.

### Source checkpoint

Checkpoints `2c1a13d..724e152` implement the gallery/home interaction contract without
changing any
Puzzle definition or progress data. The library now exposes two semantic tabs,
exactly twenty-five functional nodes per page, one canonical silhouette, one
localized name/best/Start hero, and page-aware `±1 / ±5 / Home / End` focus. Home
keeps roving keyboard focus but has no pointer-owned state, active class, pressed
attribute, or persistent selection data. Focused component/style proof is `48/48`
and typecheck is green. The first two-page frame pass is visually rejected because
its grid tracks stretch the nodes into tall rectangles and pack them too tightly.
Checkpoint `348209f` applies that presentation-only correction: every node owns a
`1 / 1` ratio, the five-row matrix centers instead of stretching, and the responsive
gaps are `12 px` desktop, `8 px` portrait, and `6 px` short landscape. Direct frame
measurement reports exact square controls at `95.02`, `46`, `64.8`, and `58.8 px`
for `1440×900`, `844×390`, `390×844`, and `360×800` respectively, with equal grid
client/scroll geometry and no page overflow. That recovery point was carried into
the final-candidate evidence below.

Independent review of evidence checkpoint `eae9a1f` accepts the square gallery and
home pointer behavior but rejects two adjacent presentation contracts. At
`844×390`, an unranked five-row result ledger clips its fifth row and both actions;
the short-landscape result must place summary and leaderboard side by side with the
two actions always visible and no internal scroll. The Puzzle range control is a
tablist, so Left/Right and Home/End on either tab must move focus and activate the
corresponding page; level-grid navigation remains separate.
The player's direct frame review additionally rejects the tall-screen outer frame:
the gallery must cap its height and fit its existing content rather than stretching
both columns to the full viewport.

Final correction range `51dd2fa..ba6bbb6` is the accepted implementation of this
contract. It fits the short-landscape ledger without internal scrolling, removes
the redundant result-rank sentence, supplies complete tablist keyboard behavior,
caps and vertically centers the gallery frame at `740 px`, preserves the complete
first-row hover border without node translation, and removes the selected-node
corner ornament. Final evidence `25cfebf` records square nodes and zero overflow at
all required viewports, staged countdown visibility, ranked/unranked ledgers,
pointer-leave and keyboard behavior, reduced motion, one Canvas, zero DOM board
cells, and zero console/page errors. Typecheck, `29 / 261` tests, and the
`756`-module production build pass; two independent read-only reviews accept with
no P0/P1/P2 finding.

## 2026-07-31 Phase 9 — cave pressure, quiet feedback, and compact navigation

The player's latest direct review opens four previously frozen presentation areas:
Survival falling stones and geology, the shared ordinary landing/line-clear response,
the fifty-level Puzzle selector, and the mode home. This Phase supersedes the
Phase-6R ordinary-clear visual rollback and the Phase-7/8 selector-composition freeze
only for the exact behaviors below. Puzzle definitions, routes, progression, records,
Mutation rules, score rules, audio, and the single-Canvas rendering boundary remain
frozen.

Three independent read-only design comparisons considered each area before source
work. Direct player review later rejected the warm/horizontal interpretation of the
first implementation. The corrected direction is one coherent slate-workbench
language:

- Survival uses a **cold slate cavern** treatment. Permanent bedrock and clearable
  falling stones share deterministic facets, chips, and short diagonal fractures
  while preserving exact cell silhouettes and seams. Bedrock is darker, denser, and
  older; falling stones are lighter fresh fracture. Long horizontal strata, warm
  brown wood tones, plank grain, and brick-wall repetition are explicitly rejected.
- Ordinary piece landing uses a **mineral imprint**: a short support-contact response
  under the cells that actually land. Ordinary line clearing uses **face release**:
  a centre-out sequence of restrained inset face blooms inside each real cleared
  cell. It draws no horizontal stroke or row band. Neither response may scale or
  displace cells, shake the well, flash the page, emit particles, or hide board state.
- Puzzle selection uses a **two-layer level bench**: a compact selected-level preview
  above one complete functional matrix. Desktop and short landscape use ten columns
  by five rows; portrait uses five columns by ten rows. All fifty levels must be
  visible without page or panel scrolling at the required viewports.
- The home uses one `TetraMorph` wordmark and a two-by-two mode matrix. The four
  entries form a functional O-tetromino-like composition through layout, not through
  copied trade dress or decorative grid lines. Selection strengthens the current
  mode color without changing CTA hue or animating font weight.

### Survival same-column stone-event contract

- Survival's normal piece cadence remains fixed at `40 ticks/cell`. Falling rock
  cadence becomes exactly `20 ticks/cell`, represented by integer Core state and
  therefore exactly two times normal Survival speed.
- Each event deterministically selects a height of one or two stones and exactly one
  column. Both choices are frozen when the two-second warning begins; a blocked event
  remains due with the same height and column and is never rerolled or redirected.
- One event has one identity. A one-stone event is one cell. A two-stone event is one
  vertically adjacent component: both cells share the selected column, move together,
  and settle in the same tick. If any required entry cell is blocked, no cell from
  that event spawns; partial entry is invalid.
- Every settled event cell becomes a clearable Survival stone cell and may complete
  an ordinary row. It does not become bedrock and does not alter the seven-bag.
- Pause advances nothing; restart clears active events, the frozen warning plan,
  timers, and accumulator. Clear mapping and bedrock movement must preserve one
  translation across every cell in an event; a nonuniform mapping fails closed.
- Warning, entry, flight, landing, clear, bedrock rise/lower, top-out, and state hash
  remain deterministic for a seed and command stream.

### Survival cavern presentation

- Board collision geometry remains a ten-column cell field. Coordinate-hashed
  variants may choose a small fixed set of facets, short diagonal cracks, chips, and
  pits; no per-frame random noise or external texture asset is allowed.
- Bedrock keeps visible seams and a darker compacted face. No horizontal layer line
  may cross a cell or continue into an adjacent cell.
- An airborne event is drawn as one rock component. A two-cell event has a shared
  perimeter and one internal fracture; a one-cell event keeps the same material
  grammar without a phantom second cell. Neither may resemble generic grey UI tiles.
- The warning is a top-edge fissure plus an exact one- or two-cell silhouette in the
  selected column, not a generic arrow. Flight uses only a short dust tail. Landing uses a
  local `120–160 ms` dust/contact response. Bedrock rise/lower uses only its newly
  exposed boundary; no full-board shake.
- Reduced motion keeps a static warning and final materials, removes interpolation
  and dust, and uses one instantaneous boundary emphasis.
- The deterministic three-row initial bedrock remains present in Core throughout the
  ready state. Renderer presentation masks it during the Survival entry countdown:
  digit `3` reveals the bottom row, digit `2` reveals the second, and digit `1`
  reveals the third. Each newly exposed row rises one cell into place over a short
  eased transition; reduced motion reveals the final row position immediately.

### Shared ordinary feedback contract

- Landing lasts at most six 60 Hz ticks (`100 ms`). It highlights actual support
  contacts and a restrained face response of at most twelve percent. A new landing
  replaces the previous landing response rather than queuing.
- Hard drop may add at most one short axial trace per occupied column, no more than
  four traces, for at most three ticks. Full-piece multi-layer ghost trails are
  rejected.
- A landing that starts a clear uses only fifty-five percent imprint strength and
  no hard-drop trace so the row response remains primary.
- Ordinary clearing completes its visible response in nine ticks (`150 ms`) inside
  the unchanged twelve-tick Core delay. Centre columns lead; every cell renders one
  fixed inset face bloom using that cell material. It uses fill-only rounded faces,
  no horizontal stroke or row band. Cells remain stationary, full size, and
  recognizable; particle count is zero.
- Survival falling-rock landing remains its own geology response. Mutation Bomb and
  Collapse remain their own effects. Puzzle anchors do not participate in the seam,
  and target ownership marks remain readable.
- Reduced motion shows a fixed contact imprint fading for four ticks and all ten
  clear faces fading together for six ticks. It does not remove feedback entirely.
- Undo, restart, screen exit, and renderer destruction clear every transient.

### Puzzle level-bench contract

- The selected preview becomes a compact horizontal bench containing the real board
  silhouette, level name/current best, and Start action. It may not consume half the
  viewport as an empty decorative well.
- The matrix groups levels `01–10`, `11–20`, `21–30`, `31–40`, and `41–50` as the
  real `3/4/5/6/7` target-row curriculum. Desktop/landscape use `10 × 5`; portrait
  uses `5 × 10`. A slightly larger gap between columns five and six may preserve the
  existing five-level unlock rhythm.
- Each level control is at least `44 × 44 px`. Ordinary nodes use mineral white and
  blue-grey edges; selected uses a solid Puzzle accent and visible outer focus;
  completed replaces its number with the existing centered tick. The best count
  appears only in the selected preview.
- Keyboard selection uses roving focus. On the ten-column matrix, Left/Right move
  one and Up/Down move ten; on the five-column matrix Up/Down move five. Enter
  selects, and the separate Start action launches the selected level.
- Selection uses only a `160–200 ms` preview crossfade/one-pixel settle. Reduced
  motion switches directly. No vertical or horizontal overflow is accepted at
  `1440×900`, `1280×720`, `2048×1152`, `844×390`, `390×844`, or `360×800`.
- The final home/selector component authority lives in
  `src/styles/navigation.css`, imported after semantic tokens and the existing
  mode/HUD layers. Historical rules in `styles.css` remain recovery context only;
  this slice must not add another late override block there.

### Home correction contract

- The page contains exactly one visible `TetraMorph` wordmark. The right side is a
  balanced two-by-two mode matrix with the existing four valid tetromino glyphs and
  mode colors; rules remain in first-entry/Settings rather than home cards.
- Pointer, focus, and arrow-key selection change only the selected card's surface,
  edge, and focus treatment. Text metrics and weight remain stable between cards.
- The real component styles load after semantic tokens so token bridge rules cannot
  silently override the accepted wordmark or mode composition.
- Desktop, portrait, and short landscape must keep all four entrances visible with
  `44 px` targets, visible keyboard focus, Enter activation, reduced-motion support,
  no duplicate name, and no meaningless copy.
- Every first-entry rules sheet uses a single localized title. Chinese joins the mode
  and `规则` without an inserted space (`生存规则`); English remains naturally spaced
  (`Survival Rules`). The redundant `首次进入说明 / First-time overview` subtitle and
  the repeated inner `规则 / Rules` heading are absent. The primary acknowledgement
  is `好的 / Got it`; the secondary action remains `返回 / Back`.
- Survival's concise rules state that every stone event randomly contains one or two
  clearable stones, all in the same random column, falling at two times normal
  Survival speed. No first-entry or Settings copy may claim a fixed pair.

## 2026-07-30 direct correction — ordinary line-clear rollback

The player's direct review rejects the Phase-6 three-stage ordinary line-clear
presentation. The shared ordinary clear returns to the pre-`1a163ff` visual baseline:
locked cells remain stationary and readable while a restrained, board-local centre-out
row sweep identifies the real cleared rows. The sweep completes within the existing
Core delay and is omitted for reduced motion.

This correction changes presentation only. It does not alter Core timing, row removal,
score, input, randomisation, Puzzle target ownership, or any mode rule. It also does not
roll back the later Classic landing/combo/speed/top-out cues, Survival pressure
feedback, or Mutation Bomb/Collapse/item effects. The rejected contraction, per-cell
dissolve, deterministic debris, and afterglow helpers/tests are removed instead of
being left as dormant alternate behavior.

### Final-gate fixture alignment

The ordinary-clear rollback does not absorb a Puzzle gameplay change. Its full suite
exposed test-only bindings that still replayed retired schema-6 routes after the
Phase-7 fifty-level boards replaced those layouts. The correction is limited to
current source-bound evidence:

- `puzzleRouteSearch.test.ts` exercises the current `01–10`, `11–20`, and `41–50`
  schema-7 artifacts;
- the browser QA specimen for `t5r-drift-08` replays that current level's frozen
  schema-7 primary route, and its direct test binds the fixture back to the artifact.

No level definition, queue, seed, solver rule, unlock rule, selector, target ownership,
or production Puzzle mechanic changes. Normal tests replay frozen routes; they do not
rerun the fifty-level solver.

## T15 phased refinement and fifty-level Puzzle contract

The current product pass follows one ordered sequence: design-system foundation,
Settings, live HUD/layout, Survival pressure, Mutation expression, Classic
micro-polish, then the fifty-level Puzzle curriculum. A later phase may consume the
tokens and primitives established by an earlier phase, but may not retroactively
change accepted game rules or hide a regression behind a broad visual rewrite.

The Puzzle selector keeps its present visual composition. Expanding the campaign may
adapt level count, selection data, unlock state, names, and records, but it may not
replace the selector with a new page design. The curriculum itself grows to fifty
deterministic authored levels and must progress from one clearly learnable construction
idea to combinations of earlier ideas. Every shipped level has at least one
Core-replayed solution, sensible fixed input, sparse solvability-safe anchors when
used, and a difficulty position supported by measured route features. Multiple
plausible routes are preferred; the player sees no route hint and no piece-count limit.

### T15 Phase 7 Puzzle-50 contract

Phase 7 opens from pushed recovery record
`d78e0e580ceb9375afb57fc8c4230624e4a54a77`. It replaces the current four
five-level presentation bands with fifty deterministic authored levels while preserving
the selector's one-preview/five-column composition. The right route becomes ten
five-level bands inside the same internally scrolling panel; target rows, unlock state,
names, completion and best-lock records are data-driven. The selector may not gain
level thumbnails, descriptive cards, decorative dots, per-level badges, a second preview
or a new page composition.

The curriculum uses exactly 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 contiguous floor target rows for levels
`01–10`, `11–20`, `21–30`, `31–40` and `41–50`. Initial targets come only from a
legal five-to-fifteen-piece zero-clear setup replay. The first five levels contain no
anchor. Across the five ten-level batches, exactly 1, 2, 3, 3 and 0 levels respectively
carry sparse authored anchors; anchors remain outside every initial target row and
cannot move, clear or count toward victory. The first forty levels therefore distribute
nine immutable-anchor lessons instead of concentrating them at the end, while the
seven-row synthesis tier prioritizes multiple readable routes over another obstacle.
Timed disappearing pieces remain removed.

Every level ships with two public-command Core routes that clear all original targets.
The routes must diverge by a canonical landing no later than the fourth lock of the
shorter route. Solver output records locks, rotations, lateral work, line distribution,
height, holes, branching, divergence and anchor burden, but is never exposed as a hint
or claimed as mathematical optimality. Normal tests replay frozen routes instead of
rerunning fifty searches.

A fresh save opens `01–03`; any two open `04–05`; any three of `01–05` open
`06–10`; thereafter any three completions in a five-level band open the next band.
Progression advances only through an already-open frontier. A migrated out-of-order
completion remains replayable but cannot leapfrog unopened prerequisite bands. Locked
levels remain visible, disabled and unable to record completion.

Puzzle progress advances to v5 with a campaign revision. The old v4/v3/v2/v1 twenty-ID
domains remain frozen for parsing. Legal historical completion IDs migrate and write
back immediately; old keys remain untouched for rollback. Because the first twenty
boards are re-authored, old best-lock values remain historical in the old key and are
not misrepresented as current-board records. A v5 best is created only by actually
finishing the corresponding Phase-7 definition. Player-facing “操作数 / 当前最优步数”
continues to mean successfully locked tetrominoes, not input commands.

Phase 7 uses the updated dynamic resource budget. Static read-only comparisons may run
in parallel in the green state, while one writer owns each shared source slice and no
more than two heavy tasks overlap. Amber serializes new heavy work; red starts none.
Every solver, Node helper, browser and server is on-demand and released at its phase
boundary by verified ownership; WMI/CIM and name-only process termination are forbidden.

For the `21–30` five-row batch, route evidence fixes the authoring mix at seven
ten-drop ordinary boards plus three seven-drop one-anchor boards. Dense ten-, nine-,
and eight-drop anchor carriers all failed the same 24-lock, 600/480-beam public-Core
probe even when their anchor column was already full throughout the target band.
The sparser carrier is a solvability correction, not a reduced anchor quota or a
larger search allowance: every selected anchor package still needs two early-diverging
replayed routes at the unchanged bound before it can ship.

The `31–40` batch raises the target band to six rows and must turn earlier isolated
ideas into readable combinations: wells with staging shelves, offset channels,
bridges with recovery lanes, and controlled overhangs. Candidate generation therefore
uses separate ordinary and sparse-anchor pools rather than adding pegs to dense boards
after selection. Ordinary candidates may use 11–12 legal setup drops. A bounded 7/8-drop
anchor search produced no legal six-row board, while sampled ten-drop carriers could not
retain a route inside the fixed search domain after a headroom anchor was added. The
selected anchor carriers therefore use nine legal setup drops and place one consequential
anchor on an outer column already occupied throughout the six-row target band. Exactly
three selected levels retain one headroom anchor, and every selected board still needs
two public-Core routes diverging by lock four.
The six-row batch uses a fixed 30-lock, 600/480-beam verification ceiling; that larger
lock allowance reflects the extra target row and is not raised again for an individual
failure. Final ordering is based on replayed route features within the six-row band,
then reviewed for a clear structural lesson rather than sorted by a single scalar.
The retained lesson order is `曲井 / 左闸 / 错桥 / 阶井 / 悬台 / 右闸 / 双廊 /
回井 / 边塔 / 折桥` (`Bent Well / Left Gate / Offset Bridge / Stepped Well /
Hanging Shelf / Right Gate / Twin Channel / Loop Well / Edge Tower / Bent Bridge`).
The seven ordinary packages rise by shorter-route locks `11, 15, 16, 18, 19, 19,
21`. Three nine-drop anchor checkpoints remain deliberately distributed at positions
32, 36 and 39 rather than clustered by their shorter 8–9-lock solutions: their lower
cell count is not evidence that an immutable edge constraint is an easier lesson.
Every setup history, gameplay seed and anchor travels as one complete package when
ordered; no route is rebound to a different random sequence.

The `41–50` batch is the seven-row synthesis tier. It must combine earlier wells,
shelves, channels, delayed clears and recovery space into boards that remain readable
as constructions rather than random rubble. The final retained set contains ten
ordinary 14/15-drop packages. A 12/13-drop anchor pool, a dedicated 11-drop pass,
bounded topology/seed probes and two deterministic 10-drop smoke pairs produced no
two-route anchor package suitable for this tier. The measured correction removes
anchors from `41–50` rather than weakening the two-route rule or hiding a solver-only
opening in the hardest levels.

Every package still needs two public-Core routes diverging by lock four at the fixed
36-lock, 720-primary and 560-alternate beam ceiling. No individual failure may expand
that search domain. Final order and concise bilingual names are assigned only after route
metrics and human-readable structural lessons are inspected together; raw setup score
or route length alone does not define the curriculum. The measured order is `横沟 /
Cross Trench`, `中阶 / Center Steps`, `分廊 / Split Gallery`, `双塔 / Twin Towers`,
`斜廊 / Sloped Gallery`, `边井 / Edge Well`, `深槽 / Deep Channel`, `断槽 / Broken
Channel`, `叠井 / Layered Well`, and `岔口 / Forked Passage`. Their primary/alternate
route lengths are respectively `16/16`, `17/20`, `17/20`, `19/21`, `22/26`, `23/24`,
`27/23`, `24/24`, `25/25`, and `25/29` locks, with first canonical divergence at locks
`3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1`. `深槽` alone uses a 15-drop setup; the other nine
packages use 14 drops.

Mutation items are an orthogonal attachment system:

| Ordinary body | Allowed attachments |
| --- | --- |
| `I`, `O`, `T`, `S`, `Z`, `J`, `L` | Ice (`freeze`), Collapse, Bomb, or Multiplier |

No piece shape, base colour, queue slot, or material may imply a fixed item. Rendering
first preserves the ordinary body and then adds the item's core, exposed-edge rim,
surface treatment, and local energy response. Active, locked, and immediate-Next
carriers share this grammar. The independent carrier RNG and ordinary seven-bag remain
separate; preview is pure and must equal the next spawned carrier. Direct regression
coverage retains every one of the twenty-eight body/attachment pairs throughout the
later Ice, Collapse, Bomb, and Multiplier redesign. The player-facing Chinese name is
`冰冻`; `冻结` is retired. The internal `freeze` key and English `Freeze` may remain so
this presentation correction does not force a persistence/schema migration.

Ice does not stop the active piece. During its ten game seconds, automatic gravity is
fixed at one second per cell (60 fixed ticks at 60 Hz); direct movement, rotation, soft
drop, and hard drop remain available. A repeated Ice carrier resets the remaining
duration to exactly ten seconds. On expiry, Mutation returns to its current normal
cadence, whose non-Ice floor remains 0.1 seconds per cell.

Visible refinement targets remain mode-specific. Settings must become compact without
structural blank space; the live board must dominate the HUD; Survival exposes one
coherent, fair pressure model; Mutation expands its status surface only for active
effects and gives Ice/Collapse substantially stronger board atmosphere; Classic
keeps its rule purity. All phases keep one Pixi canvas, keyboard/touch accessibility,
bilingual layout, reduced-motion endpoints, deterministic Core behavior, and bounded
render/audio lifecycle.

Attachment recognition may not depend on hue alone. Active, locked, and immediate-Next
carriers preserve the ordinary tetromino body while four item families receive different
core silhouettes, exposed-edge shapes, surface textures, static marks, and local motion.
At least three non-colour cues differ between each family. A player must be able to
judge both carrier presence and item identity within 100 ms in normal colour, grayscale,
and reduced-motion endpoints.

Collapse never draws a ten-cell-wide horizontal band at the board top or through the
well. Its active field is expressed by column-local lensing, compressed vertical guide
lines, falling motes, and a short settlement pulse bound to the columns that actually
move. A continuous horizontal effect wider than 80% of the well is a visual regression.

Phase 6 owns the shared ordinary line-clear presentation. Cleared rows receive one
coherent three-part signature: first a vertically narrow row-local confirmation light,
then the existing cells contract slightly toward the row centre while dissolving, and
finally a small deterministic debris/afterglow endpoint remains at those exact rows.
The complete presentation fits inside the existing 12-tick Core clear delay; it never
adds renderer-owned waiting. One through four lines retain the same geometry and timing
while only alpha, contraction distance, and debris count rise within bounded limits.
No primitive may span the full screen or escape the Pixi well.

At the first frame, the locked cells still read as their real materials. During the
middle stage each cell remains recognisable and moves by less than one quarter-cell;
at the endpoint it leaves a faint residual silhouette until Core performs the canonical
row removal. The next decision, HUD, and input stay unobscured. Reduced motion disables
cell translation, scaling, and debris and instead holds a stationary thin confirmation
at each cleared row with a quick opacity fade. Mutation Bomb and Collapse keep their
own Phase-5 presentation and do not reuse this ordinary-clear grammar.

The Phase-6 baseline feedback is board-local and event-specific. A normal Classic
lock leaves a short contact echo directly beneath the cells that reached support;
it does not shake, translate, or scale the board. A consecutive Classic clear adds
paired short side brackets at the resolved row positions, with repetition capped at
three marks so the signal strengthens without becoming a banner. Crossing a ten-line
speed boundary adds a brief pair of descending rail ticks inside the well edges. A
Classic top-out closes the spawn zone with four short corner marks over the existing
terminal scrim. These cues may coexist, remain clipped to the well, contain no text,
and never change Core timing, input, score, or the next-piece presentation.

Reduced motion keeps the same event locations but removes travel, expansion, particles,
and repeated oscillation: contact echoes, combo brackets, speed ticks, and top-out
corners become stationary strokes with a short opacity fade. The cues are renderer
state with bounded lifetimes and are cleared by restart/unmount. They apply only to
Classic in this checkpoint; Survival pressure, Mutation activation, Puzzle feedback,
React copy, HUD structure, and audio remain frozen.

Phase 5 is independently accepted, pushed, and cleaned through `4f871ac`. Phase 6
rules, visual, and evidence-integrity QA independently accept corrected product
`9085976` with P0–P3/GAP all zero, and the coordinator accepts the complete Phase-6
claim. Recovery point `d0b7406` is pushed with exact local/tracking/remote equality.
The fifty-level Puzzle contract may now open in its own documentation checkpoint; its
selector composition is not a Phase-6 target.

## Phase 1 — TetraMorph Design System v1.0

**Scope:** a foundation pass only. It centralises the existing interface language
without redesigning any page, changing layout, rebuilding Settings, changing a board
material, or adding new interaction or animation. It builds on the accepted T14
Mutation baseline without reopening that mechanic.

| System | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Brand | `TetraMorph` alone uses Playwrite NZ Basic at its authored maximum 400 weight plus a restrained local stroke; no UI label may use the display face and no nonexistent 700 face may trigger fallback. |
| Interface | Locally bundled Space Grotesk Variable at 500/600/700 for English UI; Chinese resolves locally bundled Noto Sans SC Variable → PingFang SC → Microsoft YaHei. |
| Data | Locally bundled JetBrains Mono Variable carries scores, times, lines, countdowns, and compact key/value data. |
| Type scale | Display 28/700; heading 24/700; card title 14/600; value 24/700; body 14/500; caption 12/500. |
| Base palette | Background `#DCE7F1`; surface `#F8FAFC`; secondary surface `#EDF3F7`; border `#C4D4DF`; primary text `#102A43`; readable secondary text `#52677F`; soft non-body accent `#627D98`; board `#071522`. |
| Mode accents | Classic `#31978D`; Survival `#5878C4`; Mutation `#C77A35`; Puzzle `#8A63B3`. |
| Cards | Level 1: 16 px radius / 1 px border; level 2: 10 px radius / 16 px padding; level 3: 6 px radius. Four nested card levels are prohibited. |
| Buttons | Primary: 40 px visual height, 8 px radius, 14/600; secondary: transparent with 1 px border; icon: 36 × 36 px / 8 px radius. Existing 44 px touch-safe hit targets remain authoritative. |
| Motion | Hover 120 ms ease-out; press 80 ms; modal 220 ms; page 300 ms. These are tokens only in Phase 1, not a request to add animation. |

The renderer's shell palette resolves through the same colour contract, but ordinary
tetromino materials, Survival bedrock, stones, Puzzle anchors, and all Mutation VFX
palettes remain their independently accepted materials. The visible board field stays
the established deep navy `#071522`.

Phase 1 is accepted in two bounded parts rather than by mechanically replacing every
literal in the legacy stylesheet. Phase 1A establishes the typed/CSS vocabulary,
adopts colour and role fonts, and fixes accessibility. Phase 1B bundles the exact
Noto Sans SC variable face locally and closes the dependency lock. Component token
consumption is then verified where it has semantic context: Settings in Phase 2 and
the live HUD/cards/buttons in Phase 3. Those phases may not introduce a new arbitrary
size, radius, colour, or duration when an established token expresses the intent.

All implementation phases use one writer plus two independent read-only auditors.
The code/rules auditor compares the exact base-to-candidate range and deterministic
contracts; the target/visual auditor compares the candidate against this design
contract at every required viewport. P0/P1 findings and user-request-relevant P2
findings return to the original writer. QA never edits production paths.
The coordinator-owned phase matrix assigns the writer and both auditors before source
work begins. A corrected candidate always receives both audits again. Only a
coordinator-accepted phase may be pushed, and every accepted push is retained as the
remote recovery point for the next phase.

## Phase 2 — Settings as one connected instrument

**Status:** contract frozen at recovery base `fd26652`; source work has not started.
The prior two-card layout left an empty quadrant when Controls and Keyboard had
different heights. Its emergency horizontal replacement filled width by reducing
type and controls below the product scale. Both outcomes are rejected. Phase 2 uses
one 800 px maximum-width, natural-height, scroll-contained console with four ordered
bands: Controls, Keyboard, Rules, Records.

- **Controls.** A 52 px section rail identifies the band. Desktop places language,
  sound/volume, and the compact two-button run action together without making Restart
  and Continue span the sheet. It wraps before collision; 44 px targets and the
  design-system type scale do not shrink. There is no music control.
- **Keyboard.** Gameplay precedes Shortcuts. The two groups stack naturally, and each
  group uses exactly two columns of key/meaning pairs. Ordinary Gameplay fills 2 × 2;
  Puzzle's fifth `Z` pair spans the final row. Seven Shortcuts finish with Enter
  spanning the final row. This is a readable reference, not four scattered columns.
- **Rules.** Rules are typed facts rather than localized strings parsed by punctuation.
  Only real facts render. Three Classic facts fill three columns; four-fact modes use
  2 × 2; below 680 px they become one column. The layout may wrap text but may not
  reduce body copy below 12 px or create a fourth placeholder for Classic.
- **Records.** Records are always last. Ordinary modes render zero to five actual rows;
  empty state is one compact row. Survival exposes only time, lines, and date. Puzzle
  uses one current-level best strip and never mounts a hidden leaderboard.
- **Geometry and motion.** Direct child bands share one surface, zero inter-band gap,
  one-pixel dividers, 12 × 16 px section padding, 10 px outer radius, and no fixed
  height, equal-height stretch, or `space-between`. A short viewport scrolls the
  sheet's content. Reduced motion changes no geometry.
- **Input and lifecycle.** Settings controls declare semantic row/column positions.
  Horizontal arrows stay within a row; vertical arrows choose the nearest column in
  the adjacent row; range arrows remain native. Opening any sheet during entry
  countdown freezes the displayed digit and input-ready transition until the sheet
  chain closes. Existing modal focus handoff and same-Canvas restoration remain
  unchanged.

This phase may edit only the bounded App, direct App test, localization, coordinate
navigation branch, and Settings CSS paths named in `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`. It may not
redesign the Puzzle selector or change gameplay, records, audio, dependencies, or
renderer ownership.

## Phase 3 — stable live HUD accepted and pushed

**Status:** final candidate `741d8a6` and acceptance/recovery record `1383fca` are
pushed to `origin/main`. The shared board/HUD topology now holds across
Classic, Survival, Mutation, and Puzzle at desktop, portrait, short landscape, and
wide compact viewports. Statistics, optional Mutation status, and Next use one
stable information hierarchy; Puzzle keeps one well with two complete `1` / `2`
forecast rows.

The Canvas remains the sole board renderer and is also the authoritative keyboard,
mouse-focus, and touch surface. A transparent board-bounded interaction layer receives
tap, horizontal swipe, downward swipe, and cancellation without changing Core
coordinates or creating a DOM grid. Spawn containment is presentation-only. The final
candidate preserves bilingual accessible names, 12 px minimum HUD text, 44 px header
targets, one Canvas, reduced-motion countdown endpoints, and zero layout overflow.
The Puzzle selector composition, mode rules, materials, and later Phase-4/5/6 effects
remain outside this acceptance.

## Phase 4 — Survival pressure accepted and pushed

**Status:** source/test candidate `2af2adf` and corrected evidence `993dfc7` are
accepted by the repeated rules, visual, and UI/evidence audits with no P0–P2. The
writer record, clock field, direct scoring assertion, candidate binding, raw gates,
English surface, and full lifecycle proof all pass. The only P3s are a complete but
awkward Chinese label wrap and a static Settings frame whose modal hides the frozen
digit while the scripted/JSON `3→3` assertion proves it. Acceptance/recovery record
`fd7ef8d` is pushed to `origin/main`; Phase 5 may build only from that boundary.
Survival opens with three rows of the accepted brown square bedrock material. Its
bedrock-rise clock decreases from 13 seconds to a 6-second floor, while every three
cleared lines removes one existing bedrock row. Ordinary pieces retain the accepted
fixed Survival cadence.

An independent stone clock starts at 20 seconds and decreases by one second after each
event to a 10-second floor. Exactly two playing seconds before an event, Core selects
one or two unique columns from a deterministic RNG stream that is isolated from the
ordinary seven-bag. The selected columns become canonical state, enter the replay/hash
domain, and drive both warning and spawn. If every warned entry cell is blocked at
expiry, the event stays due with its warning intact until one of those columns can
accept a stone; it is never silently skipped or redirected. Stones descend
independently at approximately 1.5× the ordinary piece speed, become clearable board
cells, and may either obstruct play or complete a scored line. Reduced motion replaces
travelling warning motion with the same static column endpoint.

The live Survival rail keeps the accepted four-card topology: elapsed time, cleared
lines, current bedrock count plus rise clock, and the independent stone clock. This
places the endurance metric and both threats above score without adding a fifth blank
or wrapping card. The local leaderboard persists a mode-discriminated v8 Survival row
containing only elapsed ticks, lines, completion date, and required schema metadata;
v7 migration deliberately discards Survival score, piece count, and chain.

Core timing/RNG, Pixi stone presentation, DOM pressure readout, and persistence schema
are separate checkpoints. Existing brown bedrock and slate stone materials remain
unchanged. Acceptance must prove deterministic replay, pause/restart and top-out
ordering, stored warning/spawn agreement, blocked-entry deferral, stone-assisted
clears, 13→6 and 20→10 boundaries, one-to-two stone events, records containing only
survival time/lines/date, responsive readability, one Canvas, zero DOM cells, no
leaks, and independent rules plus visual review.

## T14 Mutation VFX polish — accepted historical contract

The design authority is `docs/MUTATION_VFX_POLISH.md`, derived from the user-provided
VFX brief. Mutation keeps its original mechanical contract and is presented as a
contained **deep-space crystal instrument** inside the existing one-canvas board:
deep navy field, high-separation cyan/violet/ember/gold material language, and short
event-bound feedback. It must feel specific without imitating any commercial game's
logo, UI, soundtrack, assets, or trade dress. Player feedback authorizes a Mutation-only
6-tick / 0.1-second-per-cell gravity floor; it does not reopen any other mode's cadence.

The renderer owns all board effects through its existing Pixi layers and a bounded,
reused logical particle pool. A small timeline primitive owns phase sequencing so
visual time is not scattered through browser timers. The target states are: crystalline
Freeze with edge frost/refraction/snow; gravitational Collapse with a vertical pull
field and 120 ms settlement; staged Bomb warning/impact/shockwave/fragments; and
golden Multiplier score-light/floating value. Every item is an **attachment** to an
ordinary I/O/T/S/Z/J/L body rather than a replacement piece colour, so any shape can
carry any item and the immediate Next preview can communicate both identities. The rail
remains DOM information only and
uses a compact accessible Mutation Card. Existing Core timing, scoring, carrier
semantics, and state are intentionally unchanged except for that explicit Mutation
cadence floor. The visual layer gets a pure deterministic lookahead for the immediate
Next carrier, and its transient activation timeline is a FIFO so a single Core transition
can never overwrite a prior item effect. Reduced motion renders an informative static
endpoint.

### T15 Phase 5 baseline correction

The `fae3c96` three-way baseline audit found that the historical T14 presentation is
not yet the active Phase-5 target. Mutation item assignment currently consumes the
ordinary seven-bag stream; Ice stops gravity instead of imposing one-second cells;
Collapse recomputes settlement metadata and still presents broad top/bottom bands;
Bomb particles begin before impact; 2×/4× persistent fields collapse into the same
visual endpoint; and changing reduced-motion preference clears queued feedback.

Phase 5 therefore introduces a separate deterministic attachment RNG, keeps its pure
Next prediction aligned with the eventual body-plus-attachment spawn, and gives Ice a
60-tick gravity interval while preserving manual controls. Collapse Core shares one
column-compaction mapping with carrier settlement, while the renderer binds wells,
compression, refraction, motes, and final settling only to columns whose cells move.
No continuous horizontal primitive may span 80% of the board width. Bomb warning,
impact, shockwave, and fragments are temporally distinct; Multiplier retains explicit
2×/4× intensity in full and reduced motion. A runtime accessibility change preserves
the transient FIFO and converts the current effect to a readable bounded endpoint.

The Mutation rail is content-sized: no active timer means no status surface at all, so
the compact HUD keeps the ordinary two-column statistics/Next topology. Active timers
alone open one third status instrument and create only their own tracks with identity,
remaining time, and a semantic progress value; one, two, or three states never reserve
empty placeholder rows or columns. Chinese uses `冰冻`; Next accessibility names both
the ordinary body and its attachment or absence. Same-transition announcements retain
FIFO order rather than reporting only the last event.

Final Phase-5 browser evidence owns its local Vite process and starts it only after the
clean product tree is bound to the declared source SHA; attaching to an unknown process
on a familiar port is not source attribution. The DEV renderer snapshot may expose
read-only activation observability — current item, elapsed/duration, queued count,
active-particle count, and Collapse settlement columns — but may not mutate or bypass
Core or visual state. FIFO order and visual identity are two complementary proofs:
an observer installed before unrelated captures records every renderer-owned current /
queue transition through the complete fixed witness, including the 300 ms Collapse
case, while the four item-specific activation PNGs prove their visible endpoints.
For adjacent equal item labels, a shorter queue alone is not an instance boundary:
the observer must also see that activation elapsed time resets while duration remains
valid, so silently dropping one equal-labelled request cannot masquerade as delivery.
The evidence must not require one full-viewport PNG to begin and finish inside the
shortest activation window; that couples screenshot encoding latency to a correctness
claim and can reject a valid FIFO after the PNG has already captured. Evidence still
labels every activation frame from renderer state, captures Bomb after its real impact
boundary, captures each of the four activation endpoints again under reduced motion,
and binds one visible Collapse settlement frame to non-empty actual moved columns and
its maximum drop. SwiftShader can spend longer than the complete 260 ms Collapse
settlement lifetime in a DevTools screenshot even when capture starts in the first
quarter. A live diagnostic also proves that `drawImage` from the presented WebGL
Canvas is transparent because production correctly does not retain its drawing
buffer. Transient evidence therefore uses Pixi's read-only `ExtractSystem` to render
the current stage's exact board frame into a temporary in-memory 2D surface and encode
it synchronously in the page main thread. Renderer state is sampled immediately before
and after that extract inside the same JavaScript turn, so rAF cannot advance between
the state witness and pixels.
The result must include the CSS board bounds, source-pixel crop, PNG dimensions, a
nonblank pixel probe, file hash, and same-instance activation/trail witness. The
temporary 2D surface is never mounted and does not create a second gameplay canvas.
The export is exposed only through the DEV QA surface, is directly tested as
state-preserving, and may not enable `preserveDrawingBuffer`, pause the renderer or
retain the extracted Canvas.
Full-page Playwright screenshots remain authoritative for persistent HUD, responsive,
language and status layouts. It repeats mount/unmount twice against a home-screen
listener/RAF/audio baseline. A renderer microbenchmark alone does not prove 60 FPS; real
`requestAnimationFrame` mean and p95 are separately bounded. That acceptance sample
must use the machine's production hardware WebGL backend, record its unmasked
renderer/vendor, and fail if it resolves to SwiftShader, llvmpipe, or another software
renderer. A separate SwiftShader diagnostic may test fail-closed capture behavior, but
its compositor cadence is not a product 60 FPS measurement. The evidence run starts
from a fresh partial set, verifies its exact manifest file set, and publishes
`SHA256SUMS.txt` only after data and manifest are present. Text artifacts in this exact
Phase-5 evidence directory are pinned to LF so Windows `core.autocrlf` cannot invalidate
their committed hashes; this scoped attribute may not alter product-source EOL policy.

The one-state HUD proof is state-based, not tied to one particular stack's expiry
shape. Recollecting effects can refresh multiple deterministic ten-second timers in the
same Core transition, so a legitimate three-state stack may later move directly from
three rows to zero. The evidence harness first preserves and passes the complete
three-state responsive, English, reduced-motion and performance workload. It then
advances the real frozen Core clock tick-by-tick. If that stack expires without a
one-state suffix, the harness continues the same fixed-seed ordinary autoplay until a
real single timed effect is awarded and captures the actual rendered HUD. This fallback
has a finite fail-closed bound and may not inject state, alter a timer, change the seed,
or replace the already-completed three-state performance claim.

Lifecycle equality is sampled at equivalent stable active-game frame boundaries.
Restart intentionally schedules two nested rAF callbacks to restore Canvas focus. A
snapshot taken immediately when Core reports `playing` can therefore include one or
both finite focus frames even though neither is leaked. Before comparing first mount,
pre-restart, post-restart, or second mount, the harness awaits the same two real rAF
boundaries and then requires exact equality of all still-pending frames, global
listeners, Canvas count/identity, and open audio contexts. It never subtracts expected
focus frames or permits a tolerance. Unmount still returns exactly to the pre-game home
baseline, so a surviving frame remains a failure.
The two-boundary wait is itself fail-closed: a 2,000 ms browser timer rejects if both
rAF callbacks do not complete, and is cleared only after the second callback runs.
Timeout never produces a lifecycle snapshot or permits publication.

The home listener baseline is sampled only after Playwright has completed one stable
home-selector readiness probe. A raw post-navigation evaluation contains four
page-owned listeners before Playwright installs its actionability instrumentation;
comparing that pre-probe map to a post-interaction unmount is a probe-order error.
Hardware diagnosis and the already accepted Phase-4 evidence both show the stable
instrumented sequence `17 → 28 → 17 → 28 → 17`: Mutation contributes input,
visibility, resize, Pixi pointer-move and a second pointer-up listener, and unmount
removes all of them while closing audio and clearing rAF/Canvas/QA. Phase 5 mirrors
Phase 4 by waiting for the existing Mutation entry selector before sampling the
original home baseline, then requires exact map equality after both unmounts. It does
not warm the baseline with a game mount, filter listeners, subtract a fixed count, or
introduce tolerance.

The listener-aligned Phase-5 hardware batch was captured atomically from documentation
head `bdf4e20` while product `ee2aac5`, final gates `6d9fc6a`, and harness `45e7cfc`
remained frozen. Browser-raw `9fa98a2` contains 34 unique final PNGs plus the two
managed Vite logs; browser-index `013120a` contains the source-bound manifest and
checksum completion marker. Hardware WebGL2, exact four-item carrier coverage,
ordinary/reduced activation endpoints, real Collapse columns, FIFO ordering,
responsive one/two/three-status layouts, sub-frame timing, and the complete
`17 → 28 → 17 → 28 → 17` listener lifecycle are present. Coordinator inspection also
records that narrow three-status layouts use ellipsis for long values and labels
without clipping or structural overflow; independent visual QA, not the capture
coordinator, decides whether that presentation is acceptable.

Phase 5 is accepted on that frozen boundary. Independent rules and evidence reviews
report P0–P3/GAP zero; visual review reports P0–P2/GAP zero and one retained P3 for
narrow ellipsis of long score/status text. The P3 does not remove the item symbol,
material, progress or seconds and therefore does not obscure required Mutation
identity or duration. Acceptance `321ebc6` is pushed non-force to `origin/main` with
verified local/remote equality. Phase 6 and the fifty-level Puzzle target remain
closed, and execution pauses rather than opening a new writer path.

Phase-5 evidence is also resource-bound. Its coordinator, any independent reviewer,
and the managed browser are never concurrent: review turns are serialized, and no
browser, Vite, test, build, or diagnostic tree overlaps another heavy tree. Optional
MCP, Serena, language-server, and browser helpers are lifecycle-scoped and released
between checkpoints. Admission is lease-based rather than count-based: one lightweight
PDH snapshot establishes current headroom, then one declared owner controls one heavy
process tree with named command, children, listeners, temporary paths, completion
condition, and cleanup proof. A new lease cannot coexist with or start before release
of the previous lease. Normal admission still expects CPU below 60%, at least 6 GiB
available physical memory, committed memory at most 75%, disk queue at most 1.0, and a
clean process/listener/partial baseline, but must not loop over a fixed number of
samples to wait for a favourable reading. Resource inspection must not invoke WMI/CIM
because the inspection itself can create sustained provider load; use PDH, native
process ownership, `Get-Process`, and `netstat`. At 90% sustained CPU, stop admission
and release only verified project-owned children. System/security services and the
shared Codex app runtime are never cleanup targets.

## T13.16 Modal compositor integrity

**Status:** accepted at source `5ab9e7d` after independent code/rules, target/visual,
and evidence-integrity review. The live Pixi board remains visible and dimmed behind
every live-game sheet, but its WebGL layer never paints over the opaque Settings,
pause, restart, exit, or Puzzle-result surface. The pre-session first-entry sheet has
no Canvas and instead layers over the mode page. Live sessions retain the same one
canvas; copy, metrics, panel geometry, and Core state remain unchanged. Acceptance is
bound to the exact-SHA 20-case browser matrix and 18-case pixel audit rather than DOM
hit testing alone.

An ActionSheet-to-ActionSheet replacement is one modal ownership handoff. The outgoing
sheet may restore its saved trigger only when no successor `aria-modal` dialog exists.
If a successor is already mounted, its autofocus/focus trap owns the keyboard context;
an older delayed cleanup must not steal focus back to the canvas or retired trigger.
Only closing the final sheet restores the original focus route.

If a replacement sheet closes back to gameplay after its predecessor trigger has been
detached, the owning UI transaction must restore the stable game-canvas focus target
explicitly. It may not depend on a detached button, `body`, a fixed delay, or whichever
sheet cleanup happens last. Direct and production-browser coverage must exercise both
successor acquisition and the final cancel/close endpoint after queued animation frames.
If that cancellation returns to a still-paused run, the remounted Pause sheet—not the
Canvas—owns focus; board restoration is permitted only when the transaction actually
returns to playing with no successor modal.

## T13.15 Puzzle completion ceremony and Survival geology

**Status:** accepted after independent QA `4b0938d`. T13.14's mechanics and accepted
visual evidence remain the baseline. This pass does not change Core simulation,
campaign content, puzzle best-record semantics, or Survival debris; it gives two
currently flat visual outcomes a stronger original finish.

- **Puzzle completion ceremony.** A successful Puzzle result is an earned resolution,
  not the generic `原有方块已清除` termination sheet. It holds one compact deep-mineral
  field with four small rising tetromino fragments and a short radial trace—an original
  “assembled signal” gesture, not confetti or a commercial victory screen. The first
  finish says **恭喜你破解谜题** and makes the first-clear state unmistakable. A strict
  lower piece count says **新的个人纪录** and compares the old and new counts. A later
  non-record finish says **谜题再次破解** and retains the saved best without claiming a
  record. The ceremony omits the generic `首次完成 · X 步 · Y 消行` run-stat line; the
  level name, ordinal, route, anchor, and solution remain absent. The familiar **重来**
  and **返回关卡库** actions stay in their existing
  order and retain arrow/Enter/focus behavior. Motion lasts under 700 ms, is bounded
  inside the sheet, and resolves to a fully informative static frame under reduced
  motion.
- **Survival bedrock.** Permanent bedrock retains the approved brown raised-block
  material. It is intentionally a stable game-board unit rather than a simulated rock
  texture, fractured silhouette, or continuous shelf. Clearable falling stones stay
  separate, smaller-looking, and lighter/slate-coloured so their danger / opportunity
  role is legible at a glance. No texture asset, external art, filter, or gameplay-state
  exception is introduced.
- **Verification direction.** Browser evidence must visibly prove all three Puzzle
  completion states, reduced-motion stillness, and the established three-row brown
  bedrock at desktop and compact size. App tests freeze the outcome classification
  before progress persistence writes.

## T13.14 direct gameplay clarity, Mutation feedback, and Survival debris pass

**Status:** accepted. Player review correctly rejected the first reopened Settings
attempt `fe6db5f..7ab0886` for its structural empty quadrant, and the second correction
for its cramped full-width stack and nested forecast cards. Those attempts remain
diagnostic history only. The final range `e9db541..0bb2ba9` establishes a connected
upper Settings console and one ordinary dark Next well with two plain numbered rows;
source `866ef0a` uses readable loaded JetBrains Mono digits in place of the malformed
hand-drawn marker. Final coordinator gates passed typecheck, 22 files / 165 tests, and
the 746-module build; fresh desktop, short-landscape, portrait, and reduced-motion
evidence passed. Independent QA `b60511e` accepts the full corrective range with no
P0–P2 finding. T13.13 remains accepted historical evidence, but its additive item-
timer and music decisions are superseded wherever they conflict with this section.

- **Puzzle selector completion token.** The centred numeral/tick replacement is an
  already accepted baseline and is outside this pass. It remains frozen: a level card
  has exactly one centred state token, with a completed card replacing (not supplementing)
  its two-digit numeral using one centred accessible SVG tick.
- **Entry, Settings, rail, and language.** Restore the visible 3 → 2 → 1 entry
  countdown and its board overlay. Recompose Settings into a compact, intentionally
  filled sheet in its established order: controls, keyboard, rules, then records.
  Survival record rows show only survival duration and cleared lines. Puzzle removes
  the redundant `通关目标` label and names its counter `操作数`; its forecast uses one
  ordinary two-row Next well with a plain `1` / `2` marker on the left of each upcoming
  piece, rather than a floating `②`. Classic and 异变 call their gravity metric `下落速度/格` (and use the
  matching English unit). The page wordmark remains the only decorative display face;
  all other visible typography must be deliberately readable, stable, bilingual, and
  more expressive through original weight, spacing, hierarchy, and data treatment—not
  through transient synthetic bolding.
  Settings uses a connected upper console rather than a visually balanced but empty
  two-column poster or a full-width stack of microtype: controls and keyboard share an
  aligned first row as sections of the same surface, while concise rules and the useful
  record strip follow as content-sized bands. There is no detached unequal card,
  expanded spacer, stretched grid track, or forced microscopic copy. An empty
  leaderboard uses a short useful state row instead of an enlarged blank card. Desktop,
  Chinese/English, and compact portrait/landscape preserve the same
  no-structural-whitespace principle. A modal is an interruption,
  not a scene replacement: it dims the already-rendered board while retaining its
  current field, active piece, and forecast behind Settings, pause, restart, and exit.
  Puzzle Next reuses the ordinary single dark forecast well as two stacked physical
  rows. Each is marked only with a plain left-side `1` or `2`, rendered as a readable
  loaded JetBrains Mono numeral (and accessible Chinese/English descriptions), so the
  order cannot detach from its actual piece; circular
  number badges, pale label strips, split cards, nested cards, and doubled borders are
  prohibited.
- **Music removal.** Remove the current procedural music, its controls, and its
  lifecycle from the live product. Original effects remain enabled and independently
  controllable. This pass does not download, embed, or substitute external music.
- **Mutation.** Rebuild the four carrier materials and activation language around
  recognisable original semantics: frosted ice for Freeze, a dense gravity material
  for Collapse, an ember-core Bomb, and a bright star/mineral glow for Multiplier.
  Freeze leaves a bounded frost treatment while active; Collapse communicates heavy
  downward pressure; Bomb produces a local clear explosion; and Multiplier carries a
  clear score-light response. Effects are local, bounded, and reduced-motion safe.
  Recollecting a timed item refreshes its remaining deterministic game time to
  **exactly ten seconds** instead of adding duration. Multiplier retains its existing
  deterministic strength progression but also refreshes to ten seconds. The active
  rail state must make item identity and remaining time immediately legible; Bomb is
  self-evident through its visual result and has no explanatory rail sentence.
- **Survival.** Preserve the three-row opening bedrock and 13 → 6 second rise pressure,
  but render bedrock as varied, chipped stone rather than plain squares. Add a
  deterministic independent falling-stone stream. Its separate seeded stream clock
  starts at 20 seconds; each due emission chooses one or two distinct legal columns at
  the visible top edge, resets that clock, and shortens only the *next* interval by one
  second to a 10-second floor. The stream owns a seed independent of the ordinary
  seven-bag, so debris timing never silently changes the incoming-piece sequence.
  Active stones use an exact integer 3:2 fall accumulator (therefore 1.5× Survival's
  fixed tetromino gravity), block a currently falling tetromino exactly like a temporary
  obstacle, and never overlap the board, the active piece, or another falling stone.
  On contact they become a distinct ordinary **clearable** stone board material; unlike
  bedrock, a row completed by stone enters the normal line-clear resolution and awards
  the normal Survival score/line effects. If that independent clear occurs while a
  player piece is active, the brief resolution carries the active piece and remaining
  stones through the same board shift rather than spawning or losing a second piece.
  The stream must not reuse browser timing, must be replay-safe, and must interact
  correctly with ordinary locking, bedrock shifts, and line clears.

### T13.14 execution checkpoints

1. **Contract checkpoint (coordinator):** this record and `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` only.
2. **Entry/selector/UI checkpoint:** `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.test.ts`,
   `src/styles.css`, `src/ui/localization.ts`, `src/leaderboard.ts`,
   `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`, and direct renderer/UI tests may change
   together for countdown, node replacement, Settings, records, rail text, two-piece
   forecast geometry, modal backdrop preservation, and typography. It may not change
   Core rules.
3. **Music removal checkpoint:** `src/game/audio/AudioEngine.ts`, its direct tests, and
   the directly dependent App/localization paths may change only to remove music while
   preserving original effect audio and teardown.
4. **Mutation Core/render checkpoint:** `src/game/core/constants.ts`,
   `src/game/core/types.ts`, `src/game/core/mutation.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`,
   direct Core tests, `src/game/render/theme.ts`, `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`,
   and direct renderer tests form an authorised coupled boundary for timer reset,
   material, and visual-event semantics. No Puzzle content may change.
5. **Survival Core/render checkpoint:** the same typed Core boundary plus direct race
   tests and the renderer/theme paths may change together only for deterministic
   falling stones and stone materials. It must preserve fresh-seed replayability.
   This is an atomic typed bridge: introducing the stone board material expands both
   `BoardMaterial` and `GameState`, so Core collision/state fields, the Pixi material
   route, direct regression tests, and the DEV-visible state/rule copy must land in
   one typechecking checkpoint. The exact permitted paths are `src/game/core/types.ts`,
   `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`,
   `src/game/core/race.test.ts`, `src/game/render/theme.ts`,
   `src/game/render/theme.test.ts`, `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`,
   `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.test.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, and
   `src/ui/localization.ts`. This one checkpoint may exceed the normal 500 handwritten
   line budget only because a partially landed sentinel/material/event would either
   fail the typed renderer or let the board show an undefined material.
6. **Verification:** each source checkpoint receives focused tests. The final candidate
   requires typecheck, the full test suite, production build, and real desktop,
   portrait, landscape, and reduced-motion browser evidence. Evidence must show the
   3/2/1 overlay, compact Settings, two Next previews,
   no music UI/runtime, a timer refresh, all four Mutation states, a visible stonefall,
   one canvas/zero DOM cells, no overflow, and zero console/page errors.

## T13.13 selector legibility, settings hierarchy, and Mutation reliability pass

**Status:** accepted bounded repair `fcd6fce..3e2bcd9` after separate Core,
interface, renderer/audio, browser, and independent-QA passes. The first independent
review correctly held acceptance for final-candidate evidence provenance; the closure
review accepted fresh desktop, portrait, landscape, and reduced-motion artifacts with
no P0–P2 finding. T13.12 remains historical evidence only and must not be cited as
proof for the requirements below.

This pass keeps the existing deterministic mode identities, Puzzle definitions,
fixed queues, locale persistence, one-canvas boundary, and original asset boundary. It
repairs the product where a player can currently lose information or an item effect.

- **Puzzle selector.** Every incomplete level numeral must remain centered and hold an
  AA-readable ink colour against both ordinary and selected surfaces; state may not
  rely on a pale selected number. A completed option replaces—not supplements—its
  centered numeral with one clearly drawn, accessible SVG tick. There is no lower-rail
  medallion, top-right badge, title-side glyph, or literal `√`. A completed selected
  title receives the completion colour; its compact `当前最优步数：x步` / `Current best:
  x pieces` shares a stable inline heading band rather than changing the panel height.
  The selected preview remains one real, unclipped, dark-well board silhouette with no
  white fills, light seams, accidental glyph residue, or overpaint at any zoom.
- **Settings and records.** Recompose Settings as a deliberate compact sheet rather
  than two loosely filled columns: controls form a stable control group, keyboard and
  rule reference form a balanced information group, and the record/leaderboard spans a
  clear final band. Its action area has equal visual weight and no empty panel that
  looks unfinished. Opening Settings from an already paused game overlays that pause
  state and exposes **继续游戏 / Continue** directly; it must not offer a detour named
  “返回暂停”. Backdrop click retains exactly the same resume result. Leaderboard rows
  place the date at the far logical end of each row, use structural layout rather than
  `·` punctuation, and retain the top-five/ranking semantics.
- **Shared game rail.** The board and information rail are separated by proportion and
  whitespace rather than a vertical dividing rule. Every mode keeps the same readable
  metric → optional Mutation state → Next rhythm. Next is a clearly bounded forecast
  instrument with sufficient cell scale and a labelled sequence, not an ambiguous empty
  dark rectangle. The Mutation status module is visibly separated from metrics and
  Next with intentional vertical spacing.
- **Mutation reliability.** A carrier activates exactly once when *any* one of its
  locked cells is removed, including when that removal is caused by a nested Bomb or
  Collapse clear. Its identity is then removed from every surviving sibling cell.
  Trigger discovery must happen from the pre-resolution carrier set so ordinary row
  mapping cannot erase the event. Freeze and Collapse begin at ten seconds; another
  activation while already active adds ten deterministic game-time seconds rather than
  resetting its timer. Multiplier follows the same additive duration rule: its first
  active trigger grants **加倍 / Double** (2× normal and item-clear points); a second
  trigger while it is active promotes it to **超级加倍 / Super Double** (4×); any later
  trigger keeps Super Double and adds another ten seconds. Expiry returns the multiplier
  to normal scoring. Bomb remains instant and supplies its direct row/score result.
- **Mutation expression.** Rebuild, rather than merely recolour, the carrier and
  activation language. A special tetromino stays a four-cell, item-owned material, but
  its per-cell identifier uses low-contrast material engraving rather than white
  symbols that can look like rendering debris. Freeze uses a bounded cold hold cue;
  Collapse uses a brief downward structural settle; Bomb uses a local three-row blast;
  Double/Super Double uses a contained score lift that visibly distinguishes 2× from
  4×. None may flash the entire board or leave a continuous animation. Reduced motion
  presents the final coloured/labelled state without moving particles. Each event gets
  a short original, non-electrical audio contour whose attack, register, and decay make
  the four effects distinguishable; a newer effect stops an older effect tail.

### T13.13 implementation boundary and checkpoints

1. **Contract checkpoint (coordinator):** this design record and `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`
   define the fixes and acceptance tests before source edits.
2. **Mutation Core checkpoint:** `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `src/game/core/types.ts`,
   `src/game/core/mutation.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`, and direct existing Core
   tests may change together to make carrier triggering, additive timing, and
   Super Double deterministic. This is an authorized atomic Core exception because the
   typed state, score calculation, event contract, and clear mapping cannot typecheck
   independently.
3. **Renderer/audio checkpoint:** `src/game/render/theme.ts`,
   `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`, `src/game/audio/AudioEngine.ts`, and their
   direct tests may change together only to bind the revised item states to original
   bounded visual/audio feedback. It may not change ordinary piece geometry, Puzzle
   rendering, or bring in assets/media.
4. **Interface checkpoint:** `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.test.ts`, `src/styles.css`, and
   `src/ui/localization.ts` may change together for selector, Settings, leaderboard,
   rail, status, Next, and bilingual copy. This is a presentation exception only; it
   may not redefine Puzzle content or generic game physics.
5. **Evidence/QA:** each source checkpoint receives targeted tests. The complete
   candidate then requires typecheck, full current-source tests, production build, and
   live desktop/portrait/landscape/reduced-motion browser evidence that exercises a
   real carrier clear, Double→Super Double extension, paused-Settings continue,
   selector completion, records, and Next. Independent QA remains read-only until a
   candidate range exists.

## T13.12 selector, settings, and Mutation expression pass

**Accepted implementation:** `9b6188f..ec36924`, independently accepted in `d7fc929`
after real local-Playwright desktop and 390px evidence. The browser connector's earlier
unavailable-page blocker remains historical provenance only; it is superseded by the
documented recovery recheck in the independent QA log.

This pass uses one coherent **mineral instrument panel** direction: a warm-white
information surface, deep-blue board field, and the four mode hues only where they
communicate a real state. Space Grotesk remains the readable bilingual UI face,
JetBrains Mono is reserved for values/keycaps, and the bold Playwrite wordmark remains
the sole decorative display face. Labels, button captions, and puzzle progress must
not inherit the display face or artificial tracking; headings may use a restrained
weight/size contrast instead of synthetic bold flashes.

- **Puzzle selector.** The selected detail has a fixed-height heading band whether or
  not a best exists. Its completed title receives the completion colour and a compact
  checkmark; the natural result copy is `历史最优：X 步` / `Best so far: X pieces` in a
  quiet body-style inline note, never a pill that changes the panel height. Nodes that
  are complete receive a visible checkmark in addition to their accessible completion
  state. The selected silhouette remains the only board preview and must have no white
  fill, stray highlight, or overflow from its SVG paths.
- **Settings and controls.** Settings becomes a scroll-contained, two-column desktop
  sheet with one compact control column and one reference column; narrow screens stack
  it without clipping. Its visual order remains controls, keyboard, rules, and record,
  but the rules become a four-line, itemised rule card with mode colour, clear lead
  fact, and no paragraph-like wall of text. Back/Escape and Settings/S remain usable
  during entry countdown; opening either cannot enable gameplay early, lose a timer, or
  leave the run paused after cancellation. The bottom row of individual touch buttons
  is removed; keyboard remains complete and the board gains unobtrusive direct touch
  gestures rather than another visible button deck.
- **Mutation.** Its rail uses Classic's score/lines/combo/fall rhythm. A fixed ledger
  between statistics and Next shows Freeze, Collapse, and Double as grey inactive rows
  or their own blue/violet/gold active colour with remaining seconds; Bomb is a direct
  one-shot result. Carrier tetrominoes are four whole-cell special materials rather
  than an ordinary piece plus a dot: faceted ice, weighted gravity blocks, burning
  bomb blocks, and star-lit score blocks. Activation never flashes the whole board:
  Freeze paints a bounded frost edge, Collapse applies a downward-weight cue, Bomb
  draws a local blast/cleared-row effect, and Double emits a contained gold sparkle.
  Reduced-motion variants are static, legible, and bounded. The last activated item
  owns the cue: any previous item music/effect tail is stopped before the new cue.
- **Palette and interaction.** Every button family has a role-specific, high-contrast
  colour treatment—neutral Back, mode-aware primary action, cool Settings/continue,
  amber restart, and danger confirmation—without hover turning controls into unrelated
  blue. All motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; no rule, record, or visual state
  relies on colour alone.

### T13.12 authorized implementation boundary

Source may change only in `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.test.ts`, `src/styles.css`,
`src/ui/localization.ts`, `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`,
`src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.test.ts`, `src/game/render/theme.ts`,
`src/game/audio/AudioEngine.ts`, `src/game/audio/AudioEngine.test.ts`,
`src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts`, and any narrowly necessary existing focused
test file. Coordinator documentation may later change only in this design file,
`docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `docs/progress.md`, the T13 coordinator/QA logs, and the root
changelog. The user-owned `package-lock.json` must not be modified, staged, or bundled.

## T13.11 brightens mode glyphs and orders the keyboard guide by use

The two requested adjustments are intentionally narrow UI refinements, made after the
accepted T13.10 delivery. They do not alter rules, controls, persistence, renderer
ownership, authored Puzzle content, or the established type system.

- The four homepage mode glyph accents retain their distinct teal, blue, amber, and
  violet identities, but move to brighter mid-tone values with clearer cell fills and
  borders against the mineral-white panel. The workbench separator remains structural
  and calm; there is no darkening of the page surface, new decorative treatment, or
  change to the mode action treatment.
- The Settings **键盘** guide presents game controls first: left/right movement, up
  rotation, down soft drop, Space hard drop, and Puzzle-only Z undo. A distinct
  **快捷键** group follows it for Settings, pause, restart confirmation, Escape
  return, and sheet navigation/activation. Both groups preserve the two-column layout,
  English equivalents, arrow/Enter accessibility, and narrow-screen readability.

### T13.11 authorized implementation boundary

Starting from accepted/pushed `25fa232`, only `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.test.ts`,
`src/ui/localization.ts`, and `src/styles.css` may change before the source checkpoint.
`docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`, `docs/progress.md`, the T13 coordinator log,
and the root changelog may record the contract, evidence, and acceptance later. The
pre-existing user-owned `package-lock.json` change is explicitly outside this slice and
must not be staged, changed, or described as a delivery file.

### T13.11 acceptance

The source candidate `fc9cc3c` was accepted by independent QA in `4457667` after
desktop and 390 × 844 live checks confirm distinct brighter mode accents, Chinese and
English gameplay-before-shortcuts ordering, Puzzle-only Z in the gameplay group, no
duplicate right-rail guide, no horizontal overflow, and zero browser warnings/errors.

## T13.10 restores an independent TetraMorph identity

The earlier `Tetra` identity was replaced by `Tetris` while reconciling an older visual
contract. That now conflicts with the requested independent game name, so the live
product returns to a distinct name as **TetraMorph**: `Tetra` keeps the four-cell
falling-block vocabulary legible, while `Morph` describes the changing board states,
Survival pressure, Puzzle routes, and 异变 items without claiming a copied product
identity.

- Every live product mark—the browser document title, loading shell, gameplay/library
  header, and accessible brand label—uses the editable plain text `TetraMorph`. The
  homepage deliberately has no duplicate top-left brand: its sole page-level `h1` is
  the dark-field wordmark. There is no Chinese companion name, commercial logo
  treatment, or claim of affiliation with another game.
- The homepage's dark left field replaces the generic `选择模式` heading with the
  TetraMorph wordmark. It is a single calm, high-contrast typographic focal point;
  the four mode entrances remain the interaction surface and retain no rule or record
  prose. The effect may use only original CSS light/shadow and the existing mineral
  palette—no grid, scanline, diagonal ornament, or copied mark.
- The display face is bold **Playwrite New Zealand Basic**, sourced through its local
  `@fontsource` package rather than a network stylesheet. The static face must be the
  actual Google Font file—not a generated fallback—and is strengthened only through
  its requested bold treatment. Its brisk,
  characterful stroke gives the TetraMorph wordmark tension without resorting to a
  copied logo. Chinese UI copy keeps the existing readable system/Noto fallback chain.
  This keeps the visual result available offline and suitable for a later application
  package.
- The Settings sheet keeps its semantic title **设置** first, then presents a named
  **控制** section (language, sound/music/volume, and run actions), a two-column
  **键盘** reference, the concise per-mode **规则**, and only then the current record or
  leaderboard as its final content block. The keyboard reference is the complete live
  map—move, rotate, soft/hard drop, Settings, pause, restart, Escape, and Puzzle-only
  undo—moved here from the right rail. The right rail therefore keeps only metrics,
  active item state, and Next. The order must stay readable at narrow widths and
  preserve the existing arrow/Enter controls.
- The UI is fully bilingual rather than partly translated: a persistent Settings
  language choice switches between `中文` and `English`; first launch follows the
  browser language safely. English must cover all visible text, aria/live messages,
  screen/dialog titles, buttons, mode rules, leaderboard/date/time labels, puzzle
  library labels, level display names, touch actions, and the canvas label. The document
  language updates with the choice. Translation is UI-only: canonical mode IDs, puzzle
  IDs/names, deterministic Core state, storage record values, and gameplay rules do not
  change. No Chinese copy may remain in an English active route.
- On the homepage the four original mode glyphs are intentionally more legible than
  before: their tetromino cells are visibly enlarged within their fixed button frame,
  while the separators between mode entrances use a clear but restrained structural
  line. They remain original geometric marks, not copied sprites or decorative grids.
- Puzzle undo is direct: after any locked Puzzle piece, `Z` or its touch control
  immediately restores the pre-spawn board/queue checkpoint for that piece and respawns
  the same piece at the top to fall again. It does not open a confirmation sheet, retain
  the old landing translation, alter targets, reseed the fixed queue, or permit undo
  before a lock. Repeated undo walks the same pre-spawn checkpoints backward.
- Settings is pointer-complete: clicking the dimmed backdrop outside the panel has the
  same effect as **继续**. A click inside the panel never dismisses it, preserving the
  settings controls, keyboard navigation, and focused range behavior.
- During a live Puzzle run, the product identifies the mode only. It does not show an
  authored level name, a `1/20`-style ordinal, or equivalent visual telemetry in the
  header or rail; remaining original blocks, placed pieces, and the clear-all objective
  remain. The selector owns natural concise level names and the current-best label.
- Typography has one deliberate hierarchy: bold Playwrite New Zealand Basic is reserved
  for the single home wordmark, Space Grotesk carries body and interface headings, and
  JetBrains Mono is limited to compact data, controls, and keycaps. The latter two ship
  as local font files, keeping bilingual rendering stable offline.
- A selected completed Puzzle shows only `当前最优步数：x步` (and its full English
  equivalent) immediately beside its name—not above Start. The selector shows no
  visible `固定锚点` label. Its color system is rebalanced away from the current
  navy/purple heaviness toward a restrained light mineral workspace with a single
  deep-preview well and clear selected/completed contrast.
- This slice changes only presentation/localization and the deterministic Puzzle undo
  checkpoint semantics. It must not alter other mode rules, Puzzle definitions,
  persistence values, renderer geometry, or audio behavior.
  The visual proof must cover desktop and narrow responsive layouts, reduced motion,
  zero overflow, and zero browser errors.

### T13.10 authorized implementation boundary

Before the final documentation/archive records, only `index.html`, `package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.test.ts`,
`src/ui/ActionSheet.tsx`, `src/ui/localization.ts`, `src/styles.css`, `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`, `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`, `src/game/core/types.ts`,
`src/game/core/engine.ts`, and `src/game/core/puzzleUndo.test.ts` may change.
`docs/progress.md` and the coordinator workstream log may record verified evidence after
the source checkpoint. No historical contract prose is rewritten solely to rename its
past state.

## T13.9 replaces Collapse with 异变

The user rejects Collapse as a standalone mode: its column-settling rule is interesting
only as a short-lived disruption, not as the whole game. The fourth visible mode is now
**异变**. It begins and ends like a readable Classic run, but its marked carrier pieces
make local tactical changes without altering Puzzle or Survival's identity.

- 异变 uses a fresh normal seven-bag and top-out end state. Its gravity begins at the
  Classic opening cadence and steps up after every **six** cleared-line equivalents.
  The legacy internal `sprint` identifier may remain private to avoid an unnecessary
  public API migration; no page-facing copy, record, or player-facing data calls it
  Collapse or Sprint.
- After the first two input pieces, a seeded deterministic item roll may attach one
  item identity to an incoming tetromino. The one identity is carried by all four
  locked cells; every cell receives the same fine item surface while one connected
  core and perimeter accent make the carrier unmistakable. No
  item exists in Classic, Survival, or Puzzle; no carrier is inserted from wall-clock
  randomness or a non-replayable source.
- Clearing any cell belonging to a carrier activates that carrier exactly once. If
  sibling cells remain, they become ordinary cells. Metadata follows ordinary line
  clears and temporary column collapse so it cannot drift, duplicate, or fire twice.
- The first item set is deliberately legible: **冻结** stops automatic gravity for ten
  game-time seconds while leaving manual movement/drop available; **坍缩** settles the
  board's columns independently after each lock for ten seconds and resolves cascaded
  full rows; **炸弹** immediately removes the bottom three board rows whether full or
  sparse, grants score, and contributes three cleared-line equivalents; **倍增** makes
  normal-clear and item-clear points double for ten seconds. Timed effects refresh to
  the later expiry rather than spawning ambiguous stacks.
- The rail adds a compact **异变状态** surface: an icon/name plus `10 秒` countdown for
  a timed effect, or one brief factual result for an instant effect. Each carrier's
  full four-cell material is unmistakably item-specific—ice blue for **冻结**, violet
  for **坍缩**, ember coral for **炸弹**, and warm gold for **倍增**—while a central
  halo/core confirms that it is one carried item rather than an ordinary recolor. The
  piece has a bounded arrival pulse; activation gets an item-matched board flash and
  short particle response plus a concise accessible event message. Reduced motion
  preserves the four material colors and one static activation state without
  continuous motion.
- The home mode selector is intentionally navigational, not instructional: it shows
  only each mode's name, identity mark, and enter action. The first real entry into a
  mode opens a compact, dismissible rule introduction before input begins; it states
  the objective, special rule, acceleration/pressure rule, item trigger where
  applicable, and how the run ends in plain Chinese. A **规则** section in Settings
  repeats the same mode-specific facts for later reference. The introduction is
  acknowledged per mode in safe local storage, is keyboard/touch accessible, and
  never changes a deterministic game state or Puzzle definition.
- Existing v6 Collapse (`sprint`) records are semantically incompatible. The new
  persistence schema preserves valid Classic and Survival entries but resets only the
  fourth-mode table; all three current tables retain at most five date-stamped rows.
- Survival's initial bedrock is **three rows**, retains fixed 40-tick gravity, removes
  one row per three cleared lines, and raises pressure from 13 seconds down to 6.

## T13.5 replaces the time limit, not the Collapse identity

The 2026-07-24 review keeps **坍缩** because independent column settling makes it
feel distinct, but rejects its arbitrary 75-second cutoff and the ruled data rail.
It also reopens Puzzle's authored anchor distribution and level names; this is a
new bounded authoring pass, not permission to restore volatile/timed Puzzle pieces.

- **坍缩** is an endless score-and-chain run. It has no countdown, time limit, finish
  event, or time-based record. A run ends only through an ordinary top-out; its local
  table retains the top five top-outs, ranked first by cleared lines, then score, best
  collapse depth, and fewer pieces. Timed v5 Collapse rows are incompatible with this
  rule and must not mix with the new table; valid Classic and Survival rows continue to
  migrate.
- Its live rail shows only **分数 / 当前连锁 / 最高连锁 / 消行**. It groups those
  values as quiet, touch-safe metric surfaces without horizontal rules through the
  stats, Next, or keyboard sections. The dark Next well remains visually distinct,
  but spacing and tonal surfaces—not decorative divider lines—create the hierarchy.
- Survival keeps its seven-row warm-mineral opening, fixed 40-tick gravity, and
  three-line bedrock reward. Pressure now begins at **13 seconds**, falls by one
  second for every three cleared lines, and bottoms out at **6 seconds**.
- Audio is a separate finishing pass: every game event must use a distinct, audible
  but non-harsh original Web Audio contour at the existing 100% default master level.
  Add a low-key original procedural background music bed after a user gesture, with an
  independent on/off control that remains subordinate to gameplay effects. It may not
  download, sample, or imitate copyrighted music; mute, volume changes, pause, restart,
  unmount, and browser audio suspension must leave no continuing audio source.
- The Settings sheet carries the current live mode's compact **本模式排行**, preserving
  only the top five records and showing the date beside each result. Classic and
  异变 are lines-first; Survival is duration-first. Puzzle deliberately stays out
  of that table: it shows only the selected level's minimum locked-piece count after a
  real completion (otherwise `尚未通关`), never other Puzzle progress, route data, a
  hint, or a selector-side control.
- Settings is keyboard-complete as well as pointer/touch-safe: its actionable controls
  use a visible roving `←`/`→` selection and `↑`/`↓` row movement, while `Enter` uses
  the selected button. The sheet presents a compact **键盘** keycap reference for
  `S`, `P`, `R`, `Esc` return, selection/confirm, and Puzzle-only `Z`; the volume range
  retains native arrow adjustment when it owns focus. During play, `Esc` invokes the
  exact same return confirmation as the visible return button; that confirmation stays
  navigable with `←`/`→` and confirmable with `Enter`.
- The homepage mode cards separate navigation from visual selection. Hover, focus, and
  selection keep the **开始**/**选关** key in its own mode accent instead of recoloring
  it blue; selection strengthens that mode's card, border, icon, and accent surface.
  Card text has a fixed rendered weight throughout the transition, with motion limited
  to color, border, background, and position rather than an animated font change. The
  selector carries no gameplay-rule, ranking, or personal-record prose: it is only a
  clear route into a mode. A compact rule sheet appears before that mode's first live
  run, and the same factual copy remains available under **规则** in Settings.
- Music must be audibly present after the player's next valid in-game gesture at the
  default 100% setting—not merely allocated as silent Web Audio nodes. Preserve the
  original, separate-toggle procedural boundary, but write it as a wordless
  piano-like accompaniment: soft note attacks, short resonant decay, and a restrained
  melodic loop without electronic beeps, percussion, samples, network media, or a
  copied melody. Effects keep their short physical contours; landing must remain a dry
  impact rather than a sustained electrical hum.
- The in-run header keeps the back action and a clear current-mode title, but its right
  side exposes one **设置** control only. `S` opens the same accessible settings sheet;
  that sheet owns effects/music controls, the volume slider, pause/continue, and the
  confirmation-gated restart action. The current mode label must read as a primary
  heading rather than a small suffix. Each visible mode rule is one compact factual
  sentence: objective, unusual mechanic, and ranking basis only—no decorative labels
  or repeated keyboard prose.
- Every two-action confirmation sheet keeps its visible focus selection in sync with
  `←`/`→`; `Enter` activates the currently selected action rather than an invisible
  default. Escape/cancel behavior and pointer/touch operation remain unchanged.
- Puzzle retains twenty deterministic, legal five-through-eight-row setups, fixed
  queues, unlimited ordinary pieces, Z-confirmed undo, and two teaching routes per level. It
  has no volatile or expiring input mechanic. Level names become short, structural
  Chinese labels (two to four characters), rather than opaque literary phrases.
- Classic and Survival receive a fresh random seven-bag sequence for each run, while
  Puzzle queues remain fixed by canonical level. The browser implementation must stay
  wrapper-ready (safe lifecycle, storage, focus, input, and audio teardown) for a
  future application package, but this delivery adds no desktop runtime or package.
- Completing a Puzzle records the player's lowest **落子数** for that canonical level;
  the selector shows that compact personal best beside completion state. It changes
  only after a real successful run with fewer locked pieces, remains safe when storage
  is unavailable, and never changes a queue, route, or win condition. The local
  `Solutions/` walkthrough images are deferred: do not regenerate or present them in
  this delivery unless the user explicitly reopens that output.
- Puzzle's visible undo is deliberately confirmation-gated: pressing `Z` or using its
  touch-safe control opens exactly **确认** and **取消**. Confirming restores the
  Core-owned checkpoint from immediately before the latest lock, when that input piece
  had just appeared; cancelling returns to the current run unchanged. This changes no
  Puzzle definition, queue, anchor, route, target, or win condition.
- A completed selected Puzzle places its personal **最少 N 步** directly above the
  primary **开始** action. It is action-local rather than a new selector label,
  thumbnail, checkmark, or row-count fact.
- Classic, Survival, Collapse, and Puzzle use one shared live-rail grammar: soft
  metric cards, a dark bounded Next well, then compact keyboard help. Metric labels and
  values remain mode-specific, but borders, spacing, corner language, and responsive
  stacking remain consistent and do not introduce decorative rules.
- The current player-facing Puzzle hint system is removed. The paired Core-replayed
  routes remain regression evidence for reachability and early divergence only; no
  hint trigger, unlock condition, cue, strategy label, route step, or hidden input
  transcript is shown until a future explicit design pass.
- The selected Puzzle preview deliberately avoids repeated status chrome: it shows no
  `X 行残局` caption and no completion checkmark. The level name itself takes the calm
  completed-state color when that level has a record; compact personal-best and
  anchor facts remain available without turning the preview into telemetry.
- Immutable anchors remain a sparse teaching mechanic rather than scenery. An anchor
  may appear only on a curated subset of levels, never on an original target cell or
  on any initial target row. It sits in visible headroom directly above the initial
  target band, is announced as a fixed peg, and must be Core-verified to alter at
  least one legal landing or post-clear state. Every anchored level still needs two
  public-command solutions with a real early locked-piece divergence.

# Tetra — T13.2 Collapse Mode Redesign Contract

## 坍缩 is not Classic with a different counter

The 2026-07-23 clarification identifies the rejected fourth mode as Sprint, not
Puzzle. Puzzle's twenty fixed definitions, all-open selector, canonical queues,
anchors, undo, hints, and presentation are closed; this correction does not modify
any Puzzle source or visual surface.

- Sprint is renamed **坍缩**. It is a fixed 75-second score attack with a fresh live
  seven-bag and steady brisk gravity. It has no opening rubble, no target-cell list,
  no clear-a-number-of-lines finish, and no time-to-completion ranking.
- Every placed tetromino triggers an independent-column settling pass as soon as it
  locks; a completed line triggers the same pass again after it is removed. The engine
  then checks for newly formed full lines and resolves them in sequence. One placed
  tetromino can therefore create a multi-stage collapse; a normal Classic lock cannot.
- Clear score is multiplied by the square of the current collapse depth. The HUD
  exposes current chain, best chain, total score, and time remaining. The round ends
  only when its clock expires; topping out ends an attempt early without a ranked
  result.
- The renamed mode ranks completed rounds by score, then best collapse depth, total
  lines, and fewer pieces. Its title/result text must say `坍缩`, never `冲刺`,
  `清障`, `开局方块`, or `完成时间`.
- The column-collapse resolver stays in pure Core and is deterministic for a supplied
  seed. It must preserve ordinary material identity, never affect Classic, Survival,
  or Puzzle, and be directly tested for independent column settling, repeated cascade
  resolution, score multiplier, countdown finish, replay/hash stability, and fresh
  random live runs.

## T13.3 local walkthrough artifact contract

`Solutions/` is a local player-facing output directory, not a source/tooling bucket.
It contains only current `Solution-1.md` through `Solution-20.md` walkthroughs and
their linked SVG snapshots. A walkthrough is generated by replaying the schema-6 T13
primary public command route against the real Core; each snapshot is taken after a
lock's automatic resolution and records original-target count, next piece, and any
coordinate-pinned anchor. It demonstrates one feasible approach and deliberately
does not claim a unique answer or optimum.

The replay/generation implementation is versioned at
`tools/generate-puzzle-walkthroughs.mjs`; it does not participate in product startup
or mutate any Puzzle rule. Stale T12 walkthroughs, old image sets, candidate search
data, selector audits, and local generator/render scripts are retained only under the
explicit ignored recovery route
`.local/audits/t12.6-walkthrough-legacy-20260724/`. This keeps both rollback material
and player-facing output unambiguous.

## T13.4 production-test discovery boundary

The default product test command is a current-source quality gate, not a recursive
archive verifier. Vitest must discover only current `src/` test files. Historical
artifact checks beneath `docs/workstreams/` and ignored local recovery material beneath
`.local/` remain readable reference evidence, but they may not enter `npm.cmd run test`
or import obsolete route artifacts. This prevents an ignored, intentionally retained
walkthrough helper from changing the production test result.

The scoped repair may change only the repository's Vitest/Vite test-discovery
configuration and its direct documentation/tests if needed. It does not alter game
rules, Puzzle definitions, queues, anchors, selectors, rendering, storage, or the
browser bundle. Acceptance requires the unqualified default test command to list and
run the current source suite to completion, followed by typecheck and build.

# Tetra — T13.1 Quiet Fields and Excavation Sprint Contract

## T13.1 feedback correction

The 2026-07-23 feedback rejects the just-authored gravity-workbench decoration as a
finished visual direction. The product must not simulate technical depth with grid
lines, scanlines, oversized ordinal telemetry, ornamental English, or arbitrary pixel
clusters. Those elements obscure the playable objects rather than helping a player
choose a mode or a Puzzle endgame.

### Quiet entry surfaces

- Home and the Puzzle library use calm, flat mineral-paper surrounds and one dark,
  ungridded play well. Remove every decorative horizontal/vertical field line,
  `GRAVITY FIELD` label, header signal number, giant selected-level ordinal, redundant
  availability counter, and footer instruction strip. A title, an actual mode rule,
  a real selected endgame, and a reachable action are meaningful; visual telemetry is
  not.
- Remove the five-cell rising cluster and every arbitrary slanted or pseudo-tetromino
  ornament. Any remaining mode glyph is a valid connected four-cell arrangement with
  four equal square cells: Classic uses I, Survival O, Sprint L, and Puzzle T. No
  decorative extra cell, diagonal accent, or non-game block silhouette may appear.
- Keep the entry interaction restrained: hover/focus can tint a selected lane and
  shift it by only a few pixels; Puzzle selection can briefly settle the selected
  specimen. There is no looping grid, sweep, count-up, or motion that hides the
  first useful frame. `prefers-reduced-motion` receives the same final arrangement
  with no transition.
- The Puzzle library's single preview is the visual explanation of a selected level:
  enlarge it enough to read its actual cell structure at desktop and narrow widths,
  give every piece material a cohesive but clearly separated value/chroma treatment
  against the dark well, and reserve one quiet mineral accent for immutable anchors.
  Do not recolor it into an unrelated icon, blur the cell edges, or replace the real
  setup with a generic illustration. The numeric selector stays deliberately sparse
  so the preview, not decorative navigation, carries the pattern.

### Superseded excavation Sprint (historical only)

- `sprint` becomes **清障冲刺**, not a 40-line variant of Classic. Each fresh run uses
  its own random seed to generate a low seven-row ordinary rubble field with readable
  two-cell openings and no full starting row. Its normal seven-bag is fresh too; there
  are no special pieces, fixed authored route, hidden changes, timer expiry, or rising
  bedrock.
- Its objective is to clear every ordinary cell that existed in that generated opening
  field. Those opening cells are tracked as Sprint targets through normal line clears;
  later player pieces do not count. Completing the target set immediately finishes the
  run. A top-out ends the attempt without a record. This creates a fast opening-read,
  digging, and recovery challenge rather than an endless stack with a 40-line counter.
- Sprint keeps a brisk fixed fall cadence and time leaderboard: lower completion time,
  then fewer placed pieces, then score. The game HUD shows remaining/total opening
  rubble, placed pieces, and elapsed time. Its result copy says **清障完成** or
  **清障中断** and reports remaining opening rubble, never `40 行`.
- The generator is deterministic for a supplied seed, contains only ordinary
  tetromino materials, occupies only visible bottom rows, and is directly unit-tested
  for dimensions, target ownership, non-full initial rows, replay determinism, target
  mapping, completion, and fresh-run seed behavior. It remains separate from fixed
  Puzzle setups and never changes Classic, Survival, Puzzle physics, or leaderboard
  ranking policy.

# Tetra — T13 Endgame Workshop, Direct Controls, and Sprint Contract

## T13 product direction

The 2026-07-23 direction supersedes T12.7's shallow target-floor curriculum and its
tier gate. Puzzle should feel like an authored **残局**: a compact, legal mid-game
position that asks the player to read surviving structure, recognize recoverable
channels, and choose an approach, rather than fill an obvious prepared shaft. It stays
an original clean-room falling-block study; it does not copy any commercial board,
sequence, level layout, visual language, or puzzle wording.

### Repository and checkpoint discipline

- Keep versioned source, contracts, reusable authoring tools, and formal evidence in
  their mapped locations (`src/`, `docs/`, `tools/`, `scripts/`). `Solutions/`,
  `output/`, `.playwright-mcp/`, and ad-hoc browser captures are local material only;
  a source dependency or durable verifier may not live only in one of those ignored
  directories. Legacy local captures are archived below `.local/audits/` or
  `.local/logs/` by explicit topic, never left as unclassified root files.
- This T13 chain uses separate, reversible checkpoints: contract/file-map record;
  input/confirmation behavior; authored endgame Core/route evidence; Sprint Core and
  leaderboard behavior; selector/home/runtime presentation; then final evidence and
  coordinator record. Each checkpoint has an exact path list, targeted test, workstream
  log entry, and a commit before the next subsystem begins.

### Direct controls and confirmation parity

- `P` is the explicit Pause shortcut. It invokes exactly the same pause/resume action
  as the visible header control; `Escape` may retain that same action as an additional
  accessibility shortcut. A pause sheet contains only the focused **继续游戏** action,
  and `Enter` invokes it.
- Clicking **重新开始** or pressing `R` takes the identical route: when a run is active,
  it pauses once and opens one confirmation dialog. Its focused **确认** button accepts
  `Enter`; cancellation restores only a run that was playing before the request. `R`
  never directly recreates a game state. Runtime/test-only restart APIs remain direct
  programmatic APIs, not browser shortcut behavior.
- Keyboard routes must not leak through an open confirmation dialog into game input;
  pause, restart, completion, countdown, and focus behavior are covered by DOM and
  runtime tests plus browser interaction evidence.

### Open endgame workshop

- Every one of the twenty Puzzle entries is selectable on a fresh save. Completion is
  still persisted for player history and hint state, but it gates neither selection nor
  start. The library must communicate an open workshop, not a locked campaign.
- Every starting board is a visible **five through eight non-empty-row** endgame. It is
  rebuilt from a recorded legal setup history of ordinary public hard drops on an empty
  board, has no setup line clears or hidden-buffer occupancy, and preserves every
  source tetromino as an exact connected four-cell same-material component. It is not a
  randomly excavated mask or a contiguous bottom template.
- Victory remains `original-targets-cleared`: every ordinary cell that existed in the
  authored start must leave through normal line clears. Normal seeded seven-bag play
  continues with no piece budget or timer. Each level retains a stable distinct seed
  and at least two Core-replayed successful reference routes with a real locked-piece
  divergence; routes are teaching/verifier evidence, never a mandatory solution.
- The twenty boards rise in authored complexity in four visible bands: levels 01–05 use
  five rows, 06–10 six, 11–15 seven, and 16–20 eight. Within a band, more decisions,
  deeper but telegraphed cavities, anchor placement, rotation planning, and modest
  recovery room—not opaque tricks or a unique opening—define the progression.
- Add one or two **immutable anchors** to a curated subset of boards. They are visible,
  non-target, fixed-world-coordinate obstacles that survive ordinary clears. Each
  included anchor must be structurally consequential: replay evidence proves an
  anchor-aware landing or post-clear state differs from the same route on an otherwise
  anchor-free board. Anchors must neither occupy a setup cell nor make all verified
  routes collapse to a single forced answer.
- The Puzzle guide remains optional and one-intention-at-a-time. Its cue explains the
  readable endgame feature (bridge, shelf, pocket, anchor seam, or release lane), then
  presents two named approaches without input scripts or automated moves. `B` undo is
  retained as the player-controlled experimentation tool.

### Fourth mode: Sprint

- Add an original fourth mode, **冲刺** (`sprint` internally), distinct from Classic's
  escalating score chase and Survival's rising-bedrock endurance. It starts from an
  empty board with a fresh random seven-bag and a steady, slightly brisk gravity,
  completing immediately when the player clears **40 lines**. There are no special
  pieces, hidden board changes, or Puzzle targets.
- Sprint has a completion result and a local leaderboard ranked by lower completion
  time, then fewer placed pieces, then score. Its storage migration preserves valid
  Classic/Survival records and fails closed on malformed data. Core state, replay, and
  UI must distinguish Sprint completion from Puzzle completion.

### Desktop-packaging readiness (not a packaging release)

- T13 continues to ship as a browser-first Vite application. It does **not** add an
  Electron, Tauri, Capacitor, installer, signing workflow, native dependency, or a
  packaged binary in this task.
- The app is nevertheless prepared for a later desktop shell: deterministic Core stays
  free of browser globals; local persistence, visibility lifecycle, timer ownership,
  audio capability checks, and focus/keyboard handling have explicit browser-boundary
  adapters with safe no-capability fallbacks. A desktop host may replace those adapters
  without changing Puzzle, Sprint, scoring, or rendering rules.
- `src/platform/browserPlatform.ts` is the sole T13 browser capability seam for these
  concerns. It owns guarded local storage, media-query subscription, frame/timeout
  scheduling and cancellation, document/window listener teardown, deferred focus, and
  AudioContext construction. Its default implementation uses the browser only when a
  capability exists; an injected unavailable host returns inert listeners, `null`
  timers/audio, and default reduced-motion/storage values without mutating Core state.
  GameRuntime receives this boundary as an optional presentation dependency and must
  release every acquired listener on destroy. React presentation may use it for local
  saves, countdown/focus, restart keys, and action-sheet focus trapping. Pixi renderer
  DOM geometry remains browser-bound by design, but is not part of Core or a package API.
- Production assets must remain Vite-relative and offline-safe. No runtime feature may
  require a remote font, URL scheme, popup, service worker, browser tab title, or direct
  filesystem access. Existing local-only saves must retain their versioned fail-closed
  migration behavior when the storage adapter is unavailable.
- The readiness check is structural and browser-tested only: build output still opens
  under a static local host, production code has no development QA globals, and closing,
  hiding, remounting, or losing storage/audio capability leaves one clean runtime with
  no listener, ticker, canvas, or state leak. Packaging itself remains an explicitly
  deferred, separately approved release task.

### Presentation and verification

The 2026-07-23 redesign supersedes the first all-open relay treatment shown in the
interim T13 captures. It keeps the same functional contract, but replaces its loose
light cards and unused left-side canvas with one original **gravity workbench** visual
system: near-ink wells, mineral-paper surrounds, precise blue/green/purple state
accents, and sparse but consequential motion. This is a clean-room composition, not a
copy of a commercial game surface or control arrangement.

- **Mode home:** use one coherent mode field rather than a floating card stack. A clear
  product masthead and a compact four-lane gravity matrix share the same frame. Each
  lane carries only ordinal, original glyph, title, brief rule, falling-cell marker,
  and an unambiguous action. The active/hover/focus lane gains a contained accent beam
  and a short lateral settle; it must not read as four independent marketing cards.
- **Puzzle library:** use one compact endgame console. The selected real well remains
  the sole large board preview; its ordinal, name, row/anchor fact, structural cue,
  and start action live as one focused specimen surface. The twenty all-open numeric
  stops move into a dense four-band control matrix beside it, so the selector has no
  broad unused route canvas. Stops retain only ordinal, quiet completion check, and
  optional anchor notch—never thumbnails, lock icons, repeated titles, or corner dots.
  Selection sends a brief coordinate pulse from the matrix into the focused well, then
  settles; `prefers-reduced-motion` paints the final state directly.
- Both surfaces must be visually restrained but not flat: use hierarchy, contrast,
  alignment, shadows, and original tetromino-derived marks rather than explanatory
  copy or ornamental telemetry. All controls remain keyboard/touch-safe with visible
  focus and at least 44 px targets. No thumbnail grid, repeated card wall, faux
  dashboard, lock-state drama, text wall, or decorative progress-dot system returns.
- Gameplay remains one Pixi canvas with no DOM cell grid. The Puzzle guide stays a
  concise player-controlled reading aid: one cue plus two approaches, never a command
  transcript or automated input.
- Before publication: replay every setup and paired route through public Core dispatch,
  run targeted Core/input/persistence/UI/platform-boundary tests, regenerate local ignored walkthroughs,
  run one final typecheck/full suite/build, and inspect desktop, portrait, and landscape
  browser evidence for controls, open selection, all four modes, exact end states,
  no overflow, one canvas, and zero console errors.

# Tetra — T12.7 Multi-route Puzzle Guidance Contract

## T12.7 verified alternatives, gradual guidance, and authored fixed sequences

The 2026-07-22 direction extends T12.6 rather than replacing its three-through-seven-row
original-target curriculum, fixed anchors, fixed-seed Puzzle queue, undo, or current
observatory. A recorded clear route is no longer sufficient evidence for a player-facing
Puzzle: the curriculum must make room for more than one understandable approach and
must explain that room without turning the game into a command-by-command spoiler.

- Every published Puzzle level must own at least two **Core-replayed reference routes**.
  A reference route ends only at ordinary `puzzleCompletion: 'finished'`, clears every
  original target, preserves every immutable anchor, and uses the level-owned fixed
  seven-bag without mutating or pre-consuming it. The alternatives must diverge at a
  real locked-piece placement (not merely use redundant movement, an equivalent
  rotation, or a different number of settlement ticks). Their distinct opening or
  mid-board posture is a deliberate player choice, not a solver accident.
- The committed route artifact becomes the authority for every reference route and its
  replay metrics. It records a canonical route plus a second named strategy family for
  each level, the first differing lock, and a compact difficulty profile. All recorded
  routes are regression evidence only: they are neither a piece allowance, a mandatory
  sequence, an optimality claim, nor a runtime restriction.
- Recalibrate board patterns and their stable deterministic seeds where the current
  fixed input stream offers only a forced or opaque solution. Keep the visible
  three-to-seven-row bands and the existing sparse-anchor limits, but favor readable
  low channels, alternate bridge/fill order, and recoverable staging over concealed
  cavities, timing, kicks, or one-pixel-perfect placements. The first few arrivals
  must make both recorded families plausible from the visible well and the two-item
  Next rail. Any campaign reorder is evidence-led and preserves canonical IDs and
  completion-store migration.
- Difficulty is authored and displayed as a rising learning curve, not just the length
  of one route: target-row band, shortest verified lock count, amount of rotation and
  horizontal planning, the depth at which the two route families diverge, and recovery
  room all inform the ordering. A higher tier may ask for a longer composition, but it
  may not require an untelegraphed trick or remove all reasonable alternatives.
- Puzzle receives a local, presentation-only guidance layer. It is initially sealed so
  a new board gets a fair read; it unlocks permanently for that level after the player
  has placed two pieces **or** spent twenty active seconds in that level. A restart does
  not relock an earned hint. The first layer names the structural reading cue (target
  channel, bridge, anchor, or safe staging area); the second offers the two verified
  strategy families; each chosen family reveals only one short placement intention at
  a time. It never sends inputs, changes state, marks a level complete, exposes a hard
  command stream, or claims a single required answer. `B` undo remains the recovery
  affordance and should be mentioned when a guide is open.
- Guidance progress is its own small, versioned local record. It fails closed on
  malformed storage, is keyed only by canonical Puzzle IDs, and is independent from
  completion/unlock progression. Classic and Survival never render, load, or mutate
  the guide record.
- The gameplay trigger and sheet are restrained additions to the existing field: a
  compact Puzzle-only strategy action communicates its locked/unlocked state without
  crowding the audio, restart, pause, board, Next, or touch controls. The sheet uses
  semantic buttons and readable route choice, supports keyboard and touch, traps focus
  through the existing dialog primitive, and uses only brief purposeful motion with a
  full reduced-motion fallback.

T12.7 may change the authored Puzzle patterns/seeds and direct Core tests, the
route-search helper and committed route artifact, Puzzle-local hint persistence and
tests, and the Puzzle gameplay markup/tests/styles. It must not alter general physics,
rotation, normal line resolution, the randomizer contract of Classic/Survival, audio,
renderer ownership, dependencies, browser assets, or another repository. Before
publication it requires a replay of every recorded alternative, focused Core/persistence/UI
tests, one final typecheck, full suite, production build, and a desktop plus two narrow
browser-evidence pass covering locked and unlocked guidance, route selection, and
reduced motion.

# Tetra — T12.6 Layered Puzzle Curriculum and Current-Observatory Selector Contract

## T12.6 layered original-target campaign and minimal current observatory

The 2026-07-21 direction supersedes T12.5's one- through four-row, single-piece
teaching boards and its visually dense campaign atlas. Puzzle remains a fixed-seed,
ordinary falling-block game, but each authored target now asks the player to read a
small multi-row clearing composition rather than spot one obvious gap.

- Keep the current original-target victory rule exactly: a Puzzle ends only after
  normal line resolution has removed every **removable** cell that existed in the
  authored starting board. There is still no usable-piece budget, target counter
  limit, timed input, altered collision rule, special line-clear rule, or hidden
  support trick. The normal deterministic seven-bag continues indefinitely after an
  attempted route, so a verified route is teaching evidence rather than a runtime
  restriction.
- Reintroduce a small, authored distribution of **immutable single blocks** (fixed
  anchors). They are not original targets, never count toward victory, and never move
  when a line clears; ordinary target cells continue to follow the existing
  anchor-aware line-clear mapping. An anchor is fixed per level—not runtime-random—so
  Puzzle remains replayable. It may appear in only selected levels, with at most two
  singles in a board, must sit outside that board's initial original-target rows, and
  must not become a hidden spawn blocker. Every anchor placement needs a fresh Core
  replay route proving that it is an optional spatial constraint rather than an
  unresolvable obstruction.
- Replace all twenty T12.5 boards with visible, contiguous floor bands containing
  **three through seven non-empty original-target rows**. Campaign row bands ascend
  without regression: levels `01–03` have three rows, `04–06` four, `07–10` five,
  `11–15` six, and `16–20` seven. Each occupied row begins incomplete and every
  target stays within the twenty visible board rows. The openings must require a
  plausible multi-piece composition under ordinary rotation and hard drop; a direct
  single-piece gap, a concealed top stack, or a puzzle that asks the player to infer
  an untelegraphed trick is not an acceptable replacement.
- A deterministic authoring search and an independent replay through Core `dispatch()`
  must produce a legal public-command route for every level. The campaign order is
  the stable ascending tuple `(targetRowCount, locks, rotations, horizontalMoves,
  commandCount, id)` from those replayed routes; the tuple is a transparent
  feasibility/difficulty calibration, not a mathematical global-optimum claim or a
  player-facing allowance. A route may use ordinary left/right moves, clockwise or
  counter-clockwise rotation, hard drop, and required settlement ticks only.
- Keep the established three-first tier gate and state it plainly in the selector:
  `01–03` start open; completing any two levels in the preceding three-level tier
  opens the next tier through `16–18`; completing any two of `16–18` opens `19–20`.
  Existing completion IDs remain valid and sealed entries remain readable but inert.
- Generate a local, ignored `Solutions/Solution-1.md` through
  `Solutions/Solution-20.md` walkthrough set from the final replay routes. Each file
  records the command steps and embeds a board image after every locked piece. These
  are recovery/reference artifacts only: they are excluded by `.gitignore`, never
  bundled into runtime or source checkpoints, and must be regenerated after a route
  changes.
- Rebuild the selector as an original **current observatory**, not a card grid, a
  long-form archive, or a terrain atlas. The selected board is the dominant deep-well
  focal object; a sparse numbered switchback route is only a navigation instrument at
  its side. A level name, completion state, fixed-anchor note, and start action appear
  once in that focal stage—not redundantly on every stop. Decorative thumbnails,
  corner dots, progress-dot systems, faux 3-D planes, dashboard telemetry, stacked
  floating cards, and explanatory text walls remain forbidden. The full unlock policy
  is one compact, always visible transit line rather than three prose panels. The page
  has a deliberate one-shot reveal: the observatory field resolves on entry and a
  selected route sends one short sweep through the focal well. Hover/focus/press motion
  is similarly brief and spatially useful. `prefers-reduced-motion` removes those
  transitions while preserving every state distinction and control.
- Visible copy stays deliberately sparse: route sectors are number-led, and the focal
  stage carries only its selected name, semantic state, required fixed-anchor note,
  and start action. Decorative technical English, duplicate field labels, row counts,
  and section captions are forbidden; the gate remains the sole explanatory sentence.
- The selector uses the bundled local Space Grotesk face with the system CJK fallback
  stack; it must not make a runtime remote-font request merely to render the library.
- The selector remains responsive and keyboard/touch-safe. It must maintain one
  selected canonical preview only, preserve the visible unlock explanation and state
  labels, fit the 1280 × 720 desktop composition without document scrolling, and use
  internal scrolling/reflow rather than horizontal overflow on portrait or landscape
  narrow viewports. Gameplay remains one Pixi canvas with no DOM cell grid.

T12.6 may change the Puzzle definitions and their direct Core tests, the replay route
fixture/test, the Puzzle catalog markup/tests/styles, and the assigned T12
documentation/evidence records. It does not authorize physics, randomizer behavior,
ordinary line resolution, audio, renderer mechanics, dependencies, browser assets, or
other-repository changes. Before publication it requires focused Core/UI tests, one
final typecheck, full suite, production build, browser evidence at desktop and two
narrow viewports, regenerated ignored walkthrough artifacts, and new independent Core
plus visual/browser QA.

## T12.5 low-pressure Puzzle rebuild, local undo, and campaign-atlas archive

The 2026-07-19 follow-up supersedes T12.4's solver-derived piece budgets, dense
endgame requirement, retained anchors, and flat archive treatment before that candidate
is accepted or published. Puzzle is now an approachable authored curriculum, not a
long-route endurance test.

- A Puzzle is won **only** when every original target cell from its starting board has
  been removed by ordinary line resolution. There is no solver allowance, remaining
  piece counter, budget terminal state, or `failed-budget` result. Normal top-out,
  invalid-spawn, restart, and explicit exit behavior remain ordinary game behavior.
  `pieceCount` may remain an informational non-limiting statistic, but it may not be
  presented as a maximum, fraction, countdown, or failure cause.
- Replace all twenty prior deep stacks with twenty stable, fixed-seed, shallow authored
  teaching boards. The campaign progresses from direct one-piece gaps through simple
  rotations, then clear two- through four-row vertical channels. Every published route must
  use only understandable public inputs (horizontal movement, at most one ordinary
  rotation per piece where needed, hard drop, and settlement ticks); it must not rely
  on kicks, hidden support tricks, soft-drop timing, deep covered cavities, or an
  obscure multi-line workaround. Boards have a small target band near the floor, no
  timed inputs, and no permanent anchors in this curriculum. IDs and completion-store
  compatibility remain stable, while authored seeds and boards may change to make the
  intended opening input unambiguous.
- The route fixture is a regression proof of clearability and curriculum ordering, not
  an optimality claim, player-facing walkthrough, score rule, or runtime constraint.
  Its exact Core replay must finish every board. Difficulty is authored from the
  verified route's simple lock/rotation/move complexity and presented as a gentle
  ascending campaign index.
- Puzzle adds a run-local **撤回** action. `B` invokes it, and the active Puzzle shell
  also exposes an equivalent touch-safe control. It restores the exact state immediately
  before the most recently locked piece: board and original-target ownership, active
  piece, queue/randomizer, score, lines, timers, and placed-piece count all return
  together. The history is private to the live Puzzle run, starts empty, is never
  persisted or exposed through QA state replacement, and is unavailable in Classic and
  Survival. Repeated use walks backwards through earlier locks; with no checkpoint it
  is a harmless no-op. Undo cannot create, consume, reorder, or reseed a Puzzle input.
- The selector becomes an original **campaign atlas** rather than a uniform list of
  cards. It uses one coherent dossier/terrain language: a readable tier route, quiet
  terrain bands that indicate the learning arc, level records as waypoints, and a
  single selected-board detail panel. It must not restore per-level miniatures,
  upper-corner dots, a decorative progress-dot system, or a second board preview.
  Texture and depth come from restrained CSS planes, contours, route seams, and
  type hierarchy—not a copied game screen, dashboard telemetry, or generic floating
  cards. Locked and complete states remain semantic and accessible without hue alone.
- The unlock rule is visible in full, not merely inferred from a counter: `01–03`
  are open on a new save; `04–18` open in successive three-level tiers when any two
  levels in the immediately preceding tier are complete; `19–20` open when any two
  of `16–18` are complete. Existing valid completion IDs migrate without loss and a
  sealed entry remains inert.
- The selected detail keeps Puzzle's ordered double-Next preview. Gameplay keeps one
  canvas, no DOM board grid, fixed deterministic Puzzle seeds, responsive/touch-safe
  controls, the established target marker treatment, and reduced-motion behavior.

T12.5 may change the direct Puzzle Core/runtime definitions and tests, Puzzle progress
copy, App/UI/styles, the isolated campaign-route fixture/helper, and the assigned T12
workstream documentation. It does not authorize a physics, rotation, ordinary
line-resolution, audio, dependency, browser-asset, or other-repository change. Before
publication it requires focused route/undo/progress/UI tests, one final typecheck, full
suite, production build, browser evidence at desktop and narrow viewports, and fresh
independent Core plus visual/browser QA.

## T12.1 archive worktable and visible-board presentation clamp

The 2026-07-19 follow-up keeps T12's campaign, fixed-seed Puzzle routes, and seven-row
Survival rules intact. It corrects two presentation defects only: the archive must read
as a deliberate campaign instrument rather than a flat card wall, and a buffered-spawn
piece must never become visible beyond the playable well.

- The Puzzle selector is an **archive worktable**. A compact campaign rail communicates
  the opened count as one continuous bar and an explicit `opened / total` value; it has
  no decorative dots. The catalog uses numbered text records with a clear state label
  (open, complete, or sealed), a narrow selected-state edge, and a restrained mineral
  surface. There are no per-level miniatures. The single selected canonical-board
  preview remains in the detail instrument, where its ordinal, difficulty, title, and
  start action form one stable reading order.
- A sealed entry remains readable but inert: it may not take selection, start a run, or
  masquerade as an error state. Its subdued color, solid surface, and state label must
  remain distinguishable without relying on hue alone. Keyboard focus, the existing
  button semantics, responsive reflow, and reduced-motion support remain mandatory.
- The visible twenty-row well is a hard renderer presentation boundary. Core may retain
  its normal hidden spawn buffer and deterministic replay coordinates, but a visible
  active cell, outline, or rotation pulse may not render above the board's top edge.
  When interpolation would move the active group above its first visible row, the
  renderer clamps that presentation offset at the visible boundary and suppresses the
  scale pulse for that frame. Edge contact is evaluated from the **effective
  post-offset group bounds**, so an otherwise interior group translated exactly onto an
  edge also receives neutral scale; source cell coordinates alone are insufficient.
  This is renderer-only: no spawn coordinate, collision, queue, timing, seed, or puzzle
  setup may change.

## T12.3 Puzzle double-Next and final archive fit

The 2026-07-19 follow-up adds more planning information to Puzzle without changing its
fixed queue, and closes the one desktop viewport fit finding from visual QA.

- Puzzle's existing `Next` instrument renders exactly the first two already-generated
  queue items, in order: `queue[0]` then `queue[1]`. They share the same canvas-owned
  slot as a paired compact preview, and the label/accessible description makes the
  count explicit. Classic and Survival retain their single `queue[0]` preview; neither
  mode's random per-run queue contract changes. Ready and terminal states show neither
  future piece, and the preview must never invent, consume, reorder, or mutate queue
  data.
- The archive's desktop 1280 × 720 composition must fit within the viewport without a
  document-level vertical scrollbar. The catalog itself may scroll for long campaigns;
  the selected preview/detail remains in view. Portrait and landscape narrow layouts
  retain their existing internal-catalog scrolling and zero horizontal overflow.

## T12.4 solver-backed Puzzle campaign recalibration

The 2026-07-19 direction supersedes the inherited route-budget table and its old
linear unlock frontier. The previous fifteen route fixtures predate the current
original-target win condition and selected fixed anchors; they are historical evidence
only and must not be used as a budget, difficulty, or walkthrough authority.

- A dedicated deterministic campaign solver must calculate a legal public-command
  route for every one of the twenty Puzzle definitions, including its fixed seven-bag
  input sequence, original-target tracking, and anchor-aware line resolution. A route
  is valid only after an independent replay through `dispatch()` reaches
  `puzzleCompletion: 'finished'`.
- The solver-result artifact records a finite full-input domain (legal move, rotation,
  soft-drop, hard-drop, and required settlement ticks), the exact public command
  stream, lock count, replay digest, and terminal state for every level. It publishes
  **verified playable solution locks**, not an unsupported claim of mathematical
  global optimality.
- Current anchor coverage is calibrated by this evidence: an `A` overlay remains only
  when a current-Core route is verified. To honor the sparse-anchor direction without
  inflating budgets for unsupported boards, the retained overlays are
  `t3r-shaft-01`, `t3r-shaft-03`, and `t5r-prism-11`; other levels retain their
  authored board, seed, and target set without an anchor overlay.
- Every Puzzle's public `puzzlePieceBudget` becomes exactly
  `verifiedSolutionLocks * 2`. The engine still permits success on the final allowed
  lock after line resolution. There is no generic fixed slack and no legacy route
  count may survive as the source of a budget.
- The published campaign order is sorted by increasing `verifiedSolutionLocks`.
  Equal lock counts sort by the deterministic route-complexity tuple
  `(anchor count, soft-drop commands, public-command count, id)` so the visible
  difficulty index is stable, explainable, and derived from recomputation rather than
  the prior authoring order. Puzzle IDs, seeds, authored setups, and boards remain
  stable; only sparse overlay coverage, campaign order, and derived difficulty index
  change.
- A new save opens the first three solved-and-sorted levels. The remaining roster is
  grouped into tiers `[04–06]`, `[07–09]`, `[10–12]`, `[13–15]`, `[16–18]`, and
  `[19–20]`. A complete tier opens when any two distinct levels from the immediately
  preceding tier have been canonically completed. This gives a recovery choice inside
  each difficulty band while preserving a visible ascending campaign. Existing
  completed IDs remain completed during migration; unlocks are recalculated against
  the new ordered tiers and never erase a valid prior completion.
- The archive must explain the tier gate in concise Chinese, preserve one selected
  canonical preview, keep locked entries inert, and announce both the current open
  count and the next gate accessibly. Its two-item Puzzle Next preview remains queue
  display only and is independent of solving, budgets, ordering, or unlock state.

The bounded T12.4 implementation may change only the following product/test paths
after a reviewed solver result exists: `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`, direct Core campaign
tests and a new solver-result fixture/helper, `src/puzzleProgress.ts`,
`src/puzzleProgress.test.ts`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/App.test.ts`, and directly related
styles. It may add one deterministic local authoring solver under `tools/` plus its
committed result artifact under `docs/workstreams/`; both must remain isolated from the
runtime loop. It must update `Solutions/Solution-1.md` from the new first level's
verified route but keep that player walkthrough ignored by Git. It must not change
piece physics, rotation, line-clear behavior, authored boards, seeds, audio,
dependencies, or another game repository. Before publication it requires focused
solver/replay/progress tests, typecheck, the full suite, production build, browser
evidence for archive gates and two-Next, and independent Core plus visual/browser QA.

## T12 fixed anchors, no timed inputs, progressive access, and stronger feedback

The user's 2026-07-19 direction supersedes T11's volatile Puzzle input mechanism and
the unrestricted fifteen-level archive. It corrects the current anchor clear bug and
changes only Survival's opening bedrock height; Classic and all other Survival rules
remain unchanged.

- Puzzle has exactly twenty original authored levels, ordered from difficulty `01` to
  `20`. Difficulty is the monotonic order of the Core-replayed verified route bounds:
  first by lock count, then by retained-anchor count, soft-drop count, public-command
  count, and ID. The public allowance is exactly twice the verified route length;
  it is recovery room, not a mathematical-optimum claim. All levels retain a stable,
  level-owned deterministic seed and original clean-room setup history.
- A new save begins with levels `01`–`03` available. Every distinct canonical Puzzle
  completion contributes to the immediately following tier gate: each of
  `04`–`06`, `07`–`09`, `10`–`12`, `13`–`15`, `16`–`18`, and `19`–`20` opens when
  two distinct canonical completions exist in the preceding tier. Completion remains
  persistent, malformed or older data fails closed, and historic completion records
  migrate without losing their completed-level information. Locked entries are visible
  in the archive but cannot be selected or started; completion and unlock state are
  announced accessibly.
- `A` anchors are permanent **coordinate-pinned** obstacles. No line clear, including
  one below an anchor, may change an anchor's `{x,y}`. When an ordinary clear occurs
  in a Puzzle with anchors, normal cells resolve inside the vertical segments delimited
  by those fixed coordinates; normal targets continue to move deterministically and
  are removed only when their own cleared row is resolved. A line containing an anchor
  clears its removable cells while leaving the anchor in place.
- Remove the timed/volatile Puzzle-input design completely. No Puzzle input can expire,
  disappear, invoke support settlement, receive a warm volatile material, show a timer,
  or emit an expiry event/audio cue. Puzzle uses only ordinary deterministic seven-bag
  inputs, original targets, and optional fixed anchors.
- The visible `0–100%` sound control remains beside Pause, but `100%` is rebalanced as
  a clearly audible game mix: a modest master headroom boost, less aggressive
  compression, and stronger bounded sine envelopes. The mix remains transient,
  sine-only, free of distortion-prone waveforms and ambient loops, and must not clip
  ordinary overlapping gameplay cues.
- The archive retains its selected canonical preview as its only board thumbnail. Its
  new progression signal is compact and semantic—difficulty, completion, and lock
  status—not a decorative dot or per-entry miniature board. Touch, keyboard, reduced
  motion, responsive geometry, one canvas, and the plain-text `Tetra` identity remain
  required. The short single-word name communicates the four-cell input vocabulary
  without borrowing the Tetris product name or logo; no Chinese companion name is
  displayed in the product shell.
- Survival now begins with exactly seven warm-mineral bedrock rows. Its 15→8-second
  pressure, one-row-per-three-lines removal, fixed 40-tick gravity, restart behavior,
  ranking, and ordinary-run random-seed contract are unchanged.

## T11 target-marked Puzzle budgets, acoustic refinement, and fixed Survival pace

## T11 target-marked Puzzle budgets, acoustic refinement, and fixed Survival pace

> Historical T11 notes below are retained for traceability. T12.4 supersedes their
> Puzzle `+10` budget, old campaign-order, and anchor-coverage statements.

The user's 2026-07-19 direction supersedes T10's permanent Puzzle-anchor overlay,
the five-row / progressive-speed Survival opening, and the previous restart-copy and
audio palette.

- A Puzzle's goal is to clear every *original target block* within that level's
  solver budget `X`. Original targets are the ordinary tetromino cells present in the
  authored visible board at startup; later player locks, active pieces, ghosts, and
  volatile pieces never become targets. Target identity follows its cell through an
  ordinary row clear and the bounded volatile support-settlement rule, and is removed
  only when that original cell clears.
- `X` is the shortest lock count among the level's currently verified deterministic
  public-command solver routes plus ten locks of fixed slack. It is a reproducible
  accepted-solver bound with room for recovery, not a claim of a globally proven
  mathematical optimum. The engine permits success on the Xth lock after line
  resolution; if targets remain then, it ends with the explicit budget failure. Each
  level owns and exposes its own solver result and its applied slack.
- Random permanent `A` anchors remain sparse and deterministic, but may occupy only a
  visible row that was entirely empty in the authored initial board. They never share
  an initial row with original targets, never count as targets, and therefore cannot
  make an all-original-target objective impossible. Five-second volatile inputs remain
  optional, seeded later-play mechanics and never count as original targets.
- Pixi keeps each original target's ordinary material and connected-piece geometry,
  then adds a restrained warm-gold inset corner bracket at its upper-left edge. It is
  a quiet piece of the existing bevel language rather than a dot, rivet, tail, glow,
  or full per-cell outer box. The marker survives normal state updates and moves with
  the canonical target coordinate; it is neither a DOM cell nor a new cell material.
- Puzzle statistics show original targets remaining, the bounded used/available solver
  locks, and a prominent countdown of the locks still available. Terminal success and
  failure copy state the target outcome rather than claiming that the full board is
  empty.
- Survival opens with exactly ten warm-mineral bedrock rows. It retains its 15→8-second
  pressure and three-line bedrock removal, but its automatic gravity is one fixed,
  slightly faster cadence for the whole run. Clearing lines never accelerates the
  falling piece; Classic and Puzzle retain their existing independent cadence rules.
- The restart sheet remains keyboard-confirmable with Enter, but its visible primary
  action is exactly `确认` and it has no explanatory small copy.
- Each new Classic or Survival run, including restart and replay, receives a fresh
  runtime seed and therefore a new seven-bag sequence. Puzzle ignores that runtime
  seed and always restores its selected level's fixed authored sequence.
- A terminal Classic or Survival record that survives leaderboard insertion is visibly
  highlighted in the result table. If it does not survive the ranked list, the result
  sheet instead gives a compact explicit non-qualification notice.
- All game feedback uses short, bounded sine-based acoustic cues with a shared soft
  envelope; square, triangle, and sawtooth voices are removed. A hard drop owns the
  complete landing voice, so its accompanying lock event cannot stack a second sharp
  waveform on top. Event differences come from timing, octave, chord shape, and
  envelope, never buzzy oscillator types or a sustained background loop.

## T10 immutable Puzzle anchors and five-second vanishing inputs

The user's 2026-07-19 direction supersedes the T5 assumption that every Puzzle
cell is removable and that every incoming piece remains active until it locks.

- Historical only — Puzzle owned a second permanent material, the `A` anchor. Anchors were visible,
  deterministic, single-cell blockers: an active tetromino cannot overlap one,
  an anchor is never erased, and a completed non-bedrock row containing anchors
  clears its removable cells while retaining each anchor. Normal rows and
  Survival bedrock semantics remain unchanged.
- Puzzle victory is `removable-board-empty`: every ordinary tetromino cell in
  both the hidden buffer and visible board must be gone; retained anchors do
  not make an otherwise solved level fail. The state hash, replay, renderer,
  preview, and QA text expose this canonical distinction.
- A deterministic, level-seeded subset of Puzzle inputs is volatile. It plays
  and locks normally; from that lock it receives exactly 300 playing ticks
  (5 seconds). Paused, ready, terminal, and non-Puzzle states never consume
  its timer. At zero that locked tetromino disappears, emits `piece-expired`,
  and triggers one deterministic support-resolution pass: only complete
  tetromino components immediately above a newly opened cell may fall straight
  down as far as they can; a component that cannot make a normal
  whole-component fall, or is not reached from that new gap, remains still.
  The expiry neither undoes normal score/line/placed-piece credit nor creates a
  replacement piece.
- The archive keeps all fifteen entries. Every entry retains its previous legal
  setup history, stable seed, deep multi-color endgame mask, and continuous
  seven-bag generation. Anchors are sparse and level-seeded rather than a
  final-three-only rule: four earlier/mid-archive entries receive one anchor,
  the final three receive two, and the remaining entries receive none. Every
  anchor occupies a pre-existing empty visible cell; the overlay is the sole
  added board difficulty and never replaces an authored stack with a simplified
  tutorial shape. Anchored entries also participate in the volatile-input draw,
  so the two mechanics can combine without being mandatory in every puzzle.
- Volatile inputs use a distinct warm-signal material while falling and after
  locking; the ordinary seven-piece materials remain unchanged. Gameplay states
  show `限时块 / 落定后 5 秒` while the marked input is active, then an exact
  rounded-up seconds value while its locked timer remains. The live DEV state
  includes the active volatile records and anchor count so browser evidence can
  compare visible and canonical state.
- Gameplay audio uses a single Web Audio master gain and a compressor safety
  stage. Its default is 100%, with an explicit mute control and a
  persistent-in-session 0–100% volume slider beside Pause. Distinct, audible
  feedback covers start/pause, movement/rotation, hard drop/lock, line clears,
  volatile expiry, Survival pressure, and terminal outcomes; all audio stays
  outside core simulation and must be released on unmount.
- Hard drop is a short paired sine landing thump, not a triangle, square, or
  sawtooth sweep: it must read as physical weight without an electrical buzz.
- The game header keeps three direct controls together: audio, `重新开始`, and
  Pause. Clicking `重新开始` pauses a live run and opens a confirmation sheet;
  Enter confirms its primary action and Escape/cancel restores the prior paused or
  playing state. The Pause sheet itself offers only continue and exit. `R` remains
  the keyboard mapping for an immediate deterministic restart in every
  playable/paused/terminal state; it clears held input and returns to the same
  selected mode or Puzzle level without changing the seed contract.

## T9 five-layer Survival opening and Puzzle archive surface

## T9 five-layer Survival opening and Puzzle archive surface

The user's 2026-07-19 direction supersedes T8's zero-bedrock opening, five-line
reward, 20-to-10-second Survival pressure, and the visually flat Puzzle library.

- Historical only — Survival began with exactly five full, unbreakable warm-mineral bedrock rows.
  Restart creates the same five-row opening; Classic and Puzzle begin with none.
- Survival pressure begins at 15 seconds and shortens by one second on each cumulative
  three-line boundary, to an eight-second floor:
  `max(8, 15 - floor(lines / 3))`. Pending-rise, safe lock/clear ordering, pause,
  restart, deterministic hashes, and top-overflow remain fail-closed.
- Crossing each three-line boundary resolves the ordinary clear, then any already
  pending rise, then removes one bottom bedrock row per crossed boundary when present.
  The timer resets under the new interval even when no bedrock can be removed.
- Survival gravity shares the existing fixed tick table but advances one table step per
  three cleared lines, capped at the existing fastest value. Classic remains on its
  ten-line progression and Puzzle remains at its accepted fixed 48-tick cadence.
- The home-facing plain-text `Tetris` identity is a clear primary heading, not a quiet
  utility label. It remains original editable text, never a copied logo or wordmark.
- Rebuild the Puzzle level selection as an original `解谜档案` surface: compact colored
  board tiles carry level number, name, completion state, and selection signal; the
  selected canonical board becomes a single strong preview and a clearly associated
  start action. Keep all fifteen levels enabled, every touch action at least 44 px,
  the exact 2:1 board data, keyboard focus, responsive portrait/landscape behavior,
  one game canvas, and reduced-motion support.
- Archive tiles carry no decorative status dot and no miniature board. The selected
  canonical board is the only Puzzle thumbnail on the selection surface.

## T8 Interface, Survival, and Records Contract

## T8 mode field, Puzzle library, Survival interval, and records

The user's latest 2026-07-18 direction supersedes the earlier rigid 1+2 mode surface,
small Puzzle return action, cropped Puzzle thumbnails, 40-to-10-second Survival
interval, and missing result leaderboard binding.

- Home is an original Tetris-shaped mode field: the three complete mode entrances land
  in a stepped composition, retain concise factual rules, and use a distinct four-cell
  motif. Puzzle uses a stable T tetromino icon and never tilts or rises on hover.
- The Puzzle library keeps all fifteen levels enabled, gives every desktop level its
  canonical colored endgame thumbnail, enlarges the selected board preview, and exposes
  an unmistakable 44 px or larger `返回模式` action. Library and home copy do not
  repeat `目标：清空棋盘`; the in-game objective statistic remains the active rule.
- Survival bedrock pressure starts at 20 seconds. Each five cumulative cleared lines
  removes one existing bottom bedrock row when present, resets pressure, and reduces
  the next interval by one second to a ten-second floor:
  `max(10, 20 - floor(lines / 5))`.
- The local result leaderboard remains mode-owned and fail-closed. Classic ranks and
  presents cleared lines as its primary record; Survival ranks and presents elapsed
  survival time in descending order. Score, lines, pieces, and timestamp are stable
  secondary tie-breaks only. Puzzle completion continues to use the separate campaign
  store.
- `index.html` owns a lightweight Tetris Loading screen. The four-cell loader is
  removed only after the React surface has painted and becomes static under
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## T7 timed Survival and restrained motion refinement

The user's 2026-07-18 review supersedes T6's fixed-speed Classic/Survival contract and
the five-lines-adds-bedrock rule. It also removes the short decorative phase bars on
the mode surface and action sheets, requires the rules to be visible and unambiguous,
and reopens motion only for small stateful feedback.

### Classic and shared falling speed

- Classic and Survival share one line-driven gravity table. Speed tier is
  `floor(clearedLines / 10)` and the exact ticks per automatic row are
  `48, 43, 38, 33, 28, 23, 18, 13, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3`; the last value is the cap.
- Classic retains consecutive-clear combo scoring. It has no terminal line target and
  displays the current automatic fall cadence rather than a player-facing level.
- Puzzle remains at the fixed accepted 48-tick cadence so the fifteen authored
  challenge references and their event/hash evidence stay unchanged.

### Timed Survival pressure and five-line reward

- Survival starts with a 40-second bedrock interval. After every five cumulative
  cleared lines the interval decreases by exactly two seconds, down to a 10-second
  minimum: `max(10, 40 - 2 × floor(lines / 5))`.
- The timer advances only while canonical status is `playing`; pause, ready, game-over,
  and finished states do not consume it. When it reaches zero it becomes pending and
  stops accumulating. The pending row rises at the next safe lock/clear resolution,
  before the next piece spawns, so no active tetromino is teleported or overlapped.
- A timed rise shifts the remaining board upward and appends one full unbreakable
  bedrock row. Top overflow ends the run. Restart clears the timer, pending state, and
  all bedrock.
- Crossing each five-line threshold resolves the ordinary clear first, then any
  already-pending timed rise, then removes exactly one bottom bedrock row if present.
  Removing a row shifts the remaining board down and inserts one empty row at the top.
  The reward resets the timer to zero under the newly shortened interval; if no
  bedrock exists, the interval reduction and timer reset still apply.
- Survival visibly exposes current bedrock height and the next-rise countdown. A
  pending rise reads `待上升`; otherwise the countdown rounds up to complete seconds.
  State hashes and seeded replay include timer and pending pressure.

### Rules, line removal, and motion language

- Remove `.phase-seam` from the mode selector and the colored `action-sheet::before`
  bar. Structural borders remain only where they divide real regions or statistics.
- Home rules stay concise but complete: Classic states combo scoring and acceleration
  every ten lines; Survival states 40-second starting pressure, one-layer removal and
  two-second interval reduction every five lines, plus the ten-second floor; Puzzle
  states authored endgame and board-empty success.
- The game dock repeats only the immediate active rule and direct cadence/countdown
  values. It does not restore long marketing explanations or a generic level label.
- Motion uses three purposeful signatures: one staggered mode-card entrance, a small
  hover/focus tetromino gesture, and brief bedrock rise/removal feedback with countdown
  urgency. No decorative phase line, perpetual ambient loop, glow, confetti, particle
  field, or layout motion is allowed. `prefers-reduced-motion` removes transforms,
  pulses, and renderer feedback without changing timing or canonical state.
- The accepted palette, typography, layout skeleton, divided facet geometry, touch
  controls, countdown gate, and plain-text `Tetris` identity remain unchanged.

## T6 bedrock material refinement

The user's 2026-07-18 review reopens only the Survival bedrock material color. The
existing blue-grey bedrock is too close to the cool-blue tetromino materials and does
not read clearly enough as a permanent geological layer. Replace its four renderer
color tokens with one restrained warm rock-brown material:

- face start `#9C8B73`;
- face end `#76664F`;
- outer edge `#40372D`;
- inner signal edge `#CDBEAA`.

This low-saturation warm mineral set separates bedrock from all seven playable piece
materials while remaining compatible with the cool `雾昼矿物` page and deep navy
well. Both face endpoints must retain at least 3:1 contrast against the well. Bedrock
geometry, divided facets, seams, relief direction, behavior, height thresholds, and
all ordinary tetromino colors remain frozen.

## Status and authority

The user's 2026-07-18 rule review opens T6 only for the three gameplay identities.
Their subsequent request for a more creative separation, followed by the explicit
replacement of Race with Survival, supersedes both earlier T6 drafts:

The accepted T5 layout, typography, `雾昼矿物` palette, divided cohesive tetromino
facets, fifteen authored Puzzle endgames, 18-tick lock window, entry countdown,
responsive behavior, and accessibility remain frozen. T6 supersedes only the former
Classic level progression and the complete Race acceleration rule:

- Classic is fixed-speed chain-score survival: consecutive clearing pieces build a
  visible scoring chain and any non-clearing lock breaks it;
- Survival uses Classic's fixed gravity but raises one permanent unbreakable bedrock
  row from the floor for every five cumulative cleared lines;
- Puzzle uses the same fixed standard speed as Classic but changes the initial board
  and terminal objective to an authored board-clearing challenge.

The serialized `level` field remains pinned to `0` in Classic and Survival. Puzzle
retains its accepted invisible level-based score/event serialization only so all
thirty frozen public-command solution references keep their event digests and final
hashes; Puzzle gravity never reads it, the UI never displays it, and success still
depends only on the canonical board becoming empty. Removing this Puzzle evidence
compatibility requires a separately authorized reference migration.
Classic owns one deterministic `combo` counter. Survival and Puzzle keep it at `0`,
and non-Classic hashes remain stable by excluding that irrelevant field from their
canonical hash payload. The internal mode key remains `race` only for replay/storage
compatibility; every player-facing label is `生存`.

The 2026-07-17 T5 milestone was independently accepted at product source
`effb353c0a4d1bef26fa524ed38d3d3653f45eb8` with formal evidence
`c0832e43dc1cdd31c074066919c229d4a9fe5518`. The user's 2026-07-18 block review
reopens only the tetromino material presentation through bounded Slice K-R3; the
accepted gameplay, layout, typography, palette, copy, and responsive behavior remain
frozen.

The user's 2026-07-16 direction opens T5 and supersedes every conflicting T3/T4
product rule. The later Puzzle clarification in the same session also supersedes the
first T5 finite-queue draft:

- the T4 Mineral Shelf presentation is rejected and must be replaced, not patched;
- Race is endless accelerating play, not a 20-line target;
- Puzzle levels are all available, are not gated by displayed difficulty, and use the
  ordinary continuous falling-piece loop against harder authored clearing goals;
- a deterministic seed is allowed, but Puzzle must never become a short supplied-piece
  exercise or a single-reference-solution memorization task;
- outside games may inform only abstract mechanics such as downstacking or target
  clearing. T5 board layouts, names, copy, visual language, interaction structure,
  code, fixtures, and assets are original clean-room work;
- the reported one-piece Puzzle stall is a release blocker.

The user's 2026-07-17 visual review supersedes the first T5 frontend candidate:

- the player-facing name is the plain-text word `Tetris`;
- `青流方阵`, its custom mark, and the complete Aqua Blueprint presentation are
  rejected rather than eligible for incremental polish;
- the replacement must remain light cyan/light-blue and high contrast, but must read as
  a direct game interface rather than a marketing page or engineering console;
- plain-text naming does not authorize copying a commercial logo, multicolor wordmark,
  proprietary font, existing product layout, or other trade dress.

The user's later typography and panel review authorizes an original open-source Google
Fonts pairing and rejects broken statistic dividers. This does not authorize a logo
font or copied wordmark: `Tetris` remains editable plain text, while typography and
numeric rhythm become part of the surrounding original interface.

The user's subsequent board review rejects the remaining isolated-tile appearance.
Four-cell tetrominoes must read as cohesive dimensional forms rather than four small
plates with four complete outlines. The permitted depth is a restrained machined
mineral relief; this supersedes the earlier flat-cell edge rule but does not restore
plastic gloss, glass, glow, detached shadow, or candy bevels.

The user's 2026-07-18 clarification supersedes only the earlier instruction to make
internal seams nearly disappear. Cohesion belongs to the tetromino's connected outer
silhouette, not to an undivided flat face: all four unit cells remain clearly legible
inside that silhouette. Shared boundaries use engraved two-tone grooves over the same
material base, while a consistent top-left light direction gives each unit a shallow
raised face. A board-well gap between same-piece cells, four detached tile shadows, or
four independent outer boxes is still rejected.

The user's later 2026-07-18 refinement treats the current composition as substantially
complete and opens no page redesign. It authorizes only two controlled changes:

- shorten the shared grounded lock window from 30 to exactly 18 fixed ticks (about
  300 ms at 60 Hz), while preserving the existing movement/rotation reset semantics
  and reset cap;
- brighten the coordinated page, surface, state, and piece palette into the exact
  `雾昼矿物` tokens below. Technology must come from the existing measured grid,
  semantic dividers, typographic rhythm, focus states, and restrained phase motion,
  not from a dark theme, neon, decorative telemetry, or new interface machinery.

The subsequent start-flow refinement adds one functional layer without reopening the
page design. After a player activates Classic or Survival `开始`, or activates `开始` for a
selected Puzzle level, the game shell appears with a centered `3`, `2`, `1` countdown.
Each number occupies exactly one second. The runtime remains in its deterministic
`ready` state throughout the countdown: gravity, elapsed ticks, audio events, keyboard
commands, and touch commands cannot start or mutate the run early. Immediately after
`1`, the overlay is removed, input is enabled, the public runtime start path is called
once, and board focus is restored. Pause/resume, restart, and replay do not create a
second entry countdown. Reduced-motion removes digit transform/opacity animation but
does not shorten or skip the three-second preparation window.

The user's later 2026-07-17 review also rejects the complete second frontend
presentation at `c9135f3252abfa3bd6d7e94c5eb2e11fc3c72a18`. It is not a visual baseline
that can be accepted through local polish. The new authority is light neo-tech
minimal: technology is expressed through exact proportions, fine edge light, clear
state changes, and one restrained motion signature rather than decorative machinery.
The accepted lifecycle, accessibility, rule binding, and detached
`structuredClone` QA snapshot fix in `c9135f3` remain behavioral requirements and
must not regress. Independent review also found 8–11 px mobile statistics and legacy
`路线` copy; both must disappear in the replacement rather than be patched in the
rejected presentation.

The user's later 2026-07-17 direction extends the accepted neo-tech foundation before
release:

- the player-facing `马拉松` name becomes `经典`; the internal deterministic mode key
  remains `marathon` only for compatibility and is never player-facing;
- the seven pieces use an original multi-hue mapping rather than seven near-equal
  cyan/blue fills or the standard commercial piece-color mapping;
- Puzzle contains exactly fifteen all-enabled original levels for this milestone;
- every authored starting board is visibly multi-colored while its color assignment
  stays independent from gameplay randomization and never changes collision geometry;
- the nine new levels strengthen the existing topology and multi-route proof instead
  of duplicating or recoloring the first six.

The user's subsequent review of frontend candidate
`248ca89551ce1293abe88e651c9953e132c816be` rejects its visual finish while preserving
its behavior and responsive information architecture. The page must feel more premium,
and the current muted, double-outlined rounded minos are specifically rejected as ugly.
The latest authority is therefore:

- every piece color is bright, saturated, and clearly separated from the other six;
- the rendering language is a precision luminous slab, not a candy, ceramic, mineral,
  jelly, or plastic tile;
- higher perceived quality comes from hierarchy, controlled translucent depth, one
  spectral cyan-to-blue rail, and reduced component repetition, not dark neon, a
  marketing hero, decorative English telemetry, or copied trade dress;
- all accepted rules, fifteen-level bindings, selectors, accessibility, responsive
  geometry, and lifecycle proofs from `248ca89` remain mandatory.

The user's final color clarification explicitly removes the earlier cyan/green-only
page limitation. The premium page theme is `spectral glass light`: a cool near-white
base with disciplined cyan, cobalt, violet, and small coral state accents. It is not a
dark neon theme and not an unstructured rainbow.

- Base page: cool ice `#F5F7FF`; primary ink `#081426`; muted text `#52627A`;
  cool hairline `#B9CBE4`; translucent surfaces remain near-white.
- State accents: cyan `#00BFC8`, cobalt `#4767F5`, violet `#8A5CF6`, and coral
  `#FF5B7C`. Classic uses cyan-to-cobalt, Race uses cobalt-to-violet, and Puzzle uses
  violet with coral only as a small selection signal.
- The single signature rail is `linear-gradient(90deg, #00BFC8, #4767F5, #8A5CF6)`.
  CTA and focus treatments may use adjacent stops from this rail; they do not mix all
  four accents on every component.
- The background may use at most three broad, very-low-opacity cyan, violet, and coral
  light fields. It still has no repeating page grid, scanline, noise texture, or
  decorative technical coordinates.
- Gameplay piece colors remain the separate bright luminous-spectrum mapping below;
  UI state color never remaps a tetromino material.

The user's latest 2026-07-17 review rejects the resulting local Slice I checkpoint
`e552b3c86e59b801f6d69045a94211e3f1c97e34`. It remains an unpushed historical
checkpoint and is not eligible for QA, evidence, changelog integration, or push. The
following authority supersedes every conflicting bright-spectral, glass, salted-color,
and verbose-copy rule below:

- the complete page and piece palette becomes one natural, mutually compatible deep
  `暮海矿物` spectrum; darker color must create tension through controlled value and
  proportion, not neon glow, black-on-rainbow contrast, or unrelated accent colors;
- minos become matte anodized plates with restrained tonal variation. The bright
  plastic/candy fills, blurred active aura, glass blur, colored ambient light fields,
  gradient CTA fills, and luminous locked-cell treatment are rejected;
- every Puzzle starting board is an authored endgame generated from a frozen legal
  tetromino stacking history. Per-cell salted recoloring and randomly excavated masks
  are forbidden; every initial cell inherits the type and material of the exact source
  tetromino that formed it;
- all fifteen masks, state hashes, and thirty solution references are regenerated.
  Existing IDs, order, and gameplay seven-bag seeds stay stable, but the earlier mask
  and route compatibility promise is explicitly superseded;
- visible copy is reduced to names, controls, score/statistics, and the immediate
  objective. Repeated explanations of ordinary falling-block play are removed while
  full ARIA labels remain available to assistive technology.

The deterministic architecture integrated at
`4c8582854088695ebac90467842dc2bc0cef3a20` remains the rule baseline. The rejected
T4 candidate `dd7e31ea3547c18a797b2308f04161310d1412ce` remains in history but is not
an accepted visual baseline. Its uncommitted follow-up is preserved on local branch
`codex/tetris-t4-rejected-preservation` at
`1362c664629b2a83f0659f836259b84c21750fee`.

T3/T4 screenshots, manifests, reference files, and workstream logs are historical
evidence only. T5 uses new paths and does not rewrite those artifacts.

## Product and architecture invariants

- This is a clean-room deterministic falling-block game for desktop and mobile.
- Delivery remains a browser HTML webpage built by Vite. T5 does not add a native-app
  wrapper, PWA install surface, or packaged application target.
- React owns screen composition and lifecycle. PixiJS owns the board, pieces, preview,
  effects, and frame rendering.
- Gameplay uses one Pixi canvas and no DOM cell grid.
- Core state stays serializable and independent from React, PixiJS, DOM, audio,
  storage, browser timing, and viewport geometry.
- Every DEV/browser diagnostic snapshot must be detached from canonical runtime state.
  Mutating any object returned by a QA collector must not change the live run; no
  collector may expose a writable state reference or state-replacement path.
- There is no Hold mechanic.
- Grounded pieces lock after exactly 18 fixed ticks unless an already-supported legal
  move or rotation resets the timer within the unchanged reset cap. The same shortened
  window applies to Classic, Survival, and Puzzle and remains deterministic.
- Initial entry into a run has exactly one `3`, `2`, `1` countdown. While it is visible,
  the canonical state remains `ready`, every gameplay input is gated, and the runtime
  starts exactly once only after the final second.
- Keyboard and touch expose left, right, clockwise rotation, soft drop, hard drop,
  pause/resume, restart, and an explicit route back to the mode home.
- Restart, mode exit, and unmount must not multiply listeners, tickers, audio nodes, or
  canvases.

## T6 mode rules

### Classic (`marathon` internal key)

- The only player-facing mode name is `经典`; `马拉松` is removed from visible copy
  and accessibility labels.
- Classic is open-ended fixed-speed chain-score survival.
- Gravity is exactly 48 fixed ticks per automatic cell for the complete run. Clearing
  lines and placing pieces never accelerate it.
- Line clears award the fixed base table `40 / 100 / 300 / 1200` for one through four
  simultaneous lines. The first clearing piece starts chain `1`; every immediately
  consecutive clearing piece increases it by one and adds `50 × (chain - 1)` bonus
  points. A locked piece that clears no line resets the chain to `0`. There is no level
  multiplier and no chain bonus in Survival or Puzzle.
- Player-facing statistics are score, cleared lines, and current chain (`连消`).
  `等级` is not displayed or described.
- The run ends only on top-out or explicit player exit.

### Survival (`race` internal key)

Survival is fixed-speed pressure endurance. It shares Classic's 48-tick gravity but
replaces Classic's chain scoring with a board-changing floor hazard.

- The only player-facing name is `生存`; `竞速` and speed-tier copy are removed.
- There is no line target, speed curve, or successful terminal state.
- Seven-bag generation, movement, clearing, base line score, and ordinary top-out
  match normal play. Survival does not use Classic's chain counter or chain bonus.
- For every five cumulative cleared lines, exactly one solid bedrock row rises from
  the bottom. The threshold is cumulative: crossing multiple five-line boundaries in
  one resolution raises the corresponding number of rows.
- A rise occurs after the triggering normal lines have been removed and scored. Each
  rise shifts the entire remaining canonical board upward by one row and appends one
  full bedrock row at the bottom.
- Bedrock is a distinct canonical board-cell material. It blocks movement and locking,
  is visible as one coherent mineral stratum with internal units, and is never returned
  by full-row detection or removed by line clearing.
- If a rise would discard any occupied cell from the canonical top row, the run ends
  immediately as game over before spawning the next piece.
- Player-facing statistics are score, cleared lines, and current bedrock height.
- The run ends only on bedrock overflow, ordinary top-out, or explicit exit.
- Survival leaderboard rows, if retained, are endurance results rather than
  completion-time results.
- All copy and tests referring to “20 行”, “速度档”, Race acceleration, or Race
  completion are removed or migrated.

### Puzzle library

Puzzle is a library of authored board-clearing challenges, not an unlock ladder and
not a finite input-sequence exercise. It changes the starting board and win condition;
movement, rotation, fixed 48-tick gravity, locking, base scoring, line resolution, and
piece generation otherwise follow Classic play.

- All fifteen T5 levels are selectable from first launch. No level row is disabled or
  hidden behind prior completion.
- Numeric difficulty is removed from production definitions and UI. It does not
  control ordering or availability. Completion persistence is informational only.
- The goal remains canonical board empty after ordinary line resolution, including
  the hidden buffer.
- Every level has an empty hidden buffer, a non-empty original 20 × 10 visible board,
  and a stable level seed. That seed drives the shared deterministic seven-bag
  randomizer; the bag replenishes for as long as play continues.
- There is no authored finite queue, piece budget, remaining-piece counter, or
  `failed-budget` outcome. An unsolved run continues until canonical success, top-out,
  restart, or explicit exit.
- Puzzle uses Classic fixed gravity, grounded lock delay, entry delay, soft drop,
  hard drop, and SRS rotation, but not Classic's chain counter or chain bonus. Its
  invisible legacy score/event serialization remains frozen solely for reference
  compatibility. A no-clear lock and a clear both continue through the ordinary
  deterministic spawn path.
- The initial stack occupies 8–12 visible rows and is produced by 16–22 frozen setup
  pieces. It contains all seven piece types, at least seven distinct non-empty row
  shapes, four row-density classes, covered cavities in at least five columns, and at
  least eight buried holes. Repeated floor templates, three or more consecutive rows
  exposing one straight well, and an immediately obvious opening are forbidden.
- Production validation samples the first 84 generated pieces from each level seed and
  proves twelve consecutive complete seven-bags. This is a validation horizon, not a
  gameplay limit.
- Each of the fifteen levels has at least two frozen successful public-command replays for
  the same level seed. Both must clear the canonical board without state injection,
  and their semantic placement streams must differ at five or more locked-piece
  indices by final occupied cell set, landing column, and/or effective rotation. At
  least two intermediate canonical board hashes must diverge before success; a
  different command digest alone is not route diversity.
- Each accepted route uses 30–42 locked pieces, all seven piece types, at least seven
  landing columns, at least eight effective rotations, at least five non-clearing setup
  locks, and at least four separated line-resolution phases. Paired routes differ at
  five or more semantic placement indices, diverge no later than the fifth lock, and
  produce different canonical board hashes at two or more shared indices. These
  metrics establish nontrivial play; neither replay is presented as a unique or
  optimal answer.
- Authoring/verifier search stops a route after 70 locks as a bounded safety guard. The
  guard is not a production queue, gameplay limit, or player failure condition.
- The engine checks canonical-board-empty success after ordinary line resolution and
  otherwise applies normal top-out rules. Malformed initial definitions fail validation
  rather than creating a special player-facing Puzzle failure.
- References initialize through `createInitialState(level.seed, "puzzle", level.id)`
  and use public `dispatch` only. No verifier, runtime QA hook, or browser setup may
  construct, replace, or mutate canonical state.
- Every definition owns a separate `setup.seed` and an explicit ordered
  `setup.placements` list of `{ type, rotation, x }`. The declared type must equal the
  next piece drawn from that setup seed. Landing `y` is never authored or injected; it
  is derived by legal gravity and hard drop from the empty canonical board.
- Product meaning: each level is a frozen mid-game snapshot from a difficult seeded
  normal-play trace. The seed supplies the legal bag order and the signed placement
  history supplies the play already performed; neither a seed alone nor a fabricated
  occupancy mask is treated as the authored endgame.
- Setup replay uses ordinary rotation, horizontal movement, and hard drop. It must
  produce no line clear, top-out, hidden-buffer occupancy, overlap, or invalid spawn.
  Every source owner therefore remains exactly four cells whose normalized geometry
  equals the canonical rotation of its declared tetromino. Two source pieces of the
  same type may not share an orthogonal edge in the final setup, so every visible
  same-color connected component is one recognizable legal tetromino.
- `boardRows` is derived byte-for-byte from the frozen setup history. It is not a
  second handwritten authority. `BOARD_COLOR_SALT`, per-cell color draws, runtime mask
  generation, and production random excavation are removed. The separate gameplay
  seed still starts the ordinary continuously replenishing seven-bag and is never
  consumed by setup construction.
- Tests and the reference builder replay every setup from
  `createInitialState(level.setup.seed, "marathon")` through public `dispatch` only,
  then require the resulting board to match the production Puzzle board exactly. The
  pure production board constructor may reuse canonical shapes and collision helpers
  but must not import the engine or create a dependency cycle.
- The fifteen existing IDs, order, names, and gameplay seeds remain stable so the UI
  and informational completion records remain compatible. The old occupancy masks,
  setup colors, route streams, state hashes, reference SHA, and browser evidence are
  invalidated and regenerated under this authority.
- Topology validation normalizes every occupied piece character to one occupancy bit
  before counting distinct rows, densities, holes, or cavities. Color variation may
  never masquerade as geometric difficulty.
- All fifteen normalized masks are unique and every pair differs in at least 20 of the
  200 visible cells. The signed-in histories are authored and visually reviewed as
  distinct endgame motifs; the authoring/search helper may screen candidates and find
  solutions, but production never generates a board at runtime. A copied mask,
  recolored duplicate, random hole field, or one-obvious-answer opener is rejected.

## T5 `雾昼矿物` precise-light visual direction

The accepted visual target is the existing precise interface re-toned into one bright,
cool mineral daylight spectrum. The page and panels become light; the board well stays
deep so piece geometry remains dominant. This replaces the dark-shell dependency
without changing composition or returning to Aqua Blueprint, rounded ceramic, bright
spectral glass, or plastic luminous slabs. The only player-facing brand is `Tetris`
set as ordinary text in the product type system.

- Technology comes from measured spacing, crisp structural planes, semantic divider
  logic, restrained mineral state colors, functional feedback, and disciplined
  composition. It does not come
  from CAD, dashboards, decorative telemetry, generic neon futurism, or unrelated
  rainbow accents.
- Remove the custom brand glyph, `青流方阵`, `AQUA ROUTE`, coordinates, route lines,
  blueprint grids and ticks, diagonal bands, clipped corners, decorative numbering,
  all-caps engineering labels, oversized slogans, and the rejected stepped mode bands.
- Also forbid scanlines, repeating grids, decorative particles, toy/glass candy or
  plastic blocks, marketing heroes, settings-row layouts, floating-card piles,
  backdrop blur, colored ambient blobs, and technical English used only as decoration.
- Do not imitate an official Tetris logo, multicolor wordmark, commercial font,
  existing product composition, commercial level screen, or other trade dress.
- Per the user's earlier direction, `index.html` remains unchanged as the required
  Vite entry document; it already provides the browser HTML shell and `Tetris` title.
- The only ornamental motion signature is a 2 px teal-to-blue-to-violet `phase seam`: about
  72 px while idle, extending once on selection or focus over 220 ms. It never loops,
  and reduced motion switches state immediately.

### Palette

| Role | Token |
| --- | --- |
| Page | `#DCE7F2` |
| Main / raised / selected surface | `#F7FAFD` / `#EAF1F7` / `#DCE8F2` |
| Board well | `#0B1726` |
| Primary / secondary text | `#14243A` / `#52677F` |
| Line / structural edge | `#B5C5D5` / `#879DB3` |
| Classic / Survival / Puzzle / selection | `#357F78` / `#526EB0` / `#80639D` / `#A75E71` |
| Action / hover / focus / action ink | `#315F96` / `#3D70A8` / `#245E9C` / `#F7FAFD` |
| Success / failure | `#3F7F5D` / `#A64E61` |

The only page gradient is the signature
`linear-gradient(90deg, #357F78, #526EB0, #80639D)` phase seam. Buttons use solid
colors. Primary text on the main surface measures 14.93:1, secondary text 5.56:1,
and action ink on `#315F96` measures 6.25:1. The `#B5C5D5` divider is only a
non-essential separator; selection, focus, and error states always add a stronger or
non-color cue.

### Typography, surfaces, and piece language

- Load the open-source Google Fonts pairing `Space Grotesk` + `Noto Sans SC` from CSS,
  not `index.html`. The frozen CSS v2 request is
  `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@400;500;600;700;800&family=Space+Grotesk:wght@500;600;700&display=swap`.
  `Space Grotesk` owns Latin text, the plain `Tetris` title, `Next`, and tabular-style
  numerals; `Noto Sans SC` owns Chinese glyphs. Both fall back through Segoe UI /
  Microsoft YaHei UI / PingFang SC / system sans so a blocked font request remains
  readable, does not create blank text, and preserves the responsive geometry.
- The page uses solid light cool structural planes around one deep board well. It has
  no colored ambient field,
  `backdrop-filter`, repeating grid, measurement mark, grain, diagonal stripe, route
  diagram, gradient CTA, or glow shadow.
- Only the main page/game container may use the restrained `0 18px 44px
  rgba(31, 59, 86, .14)` depth. Internal regions rely on one-pixel structural edges,
  spacing, and tone rather than repeated shadows.
- Primary surfaces use 12–18 px radii. Buttons, action sheets, the board, and cells
  have no clipped corners; nested large pill/card stacks are forbidden.
- Every tetromino uses one joined `matte machined mineral` base: the existing
  135-degree two-stop field remains within about 8% lightness difference and
  orthogonally adjacent same-material cells bridge the board-well gap. The connected
  component therefore owns one uninterrupted outer silhouette rather than four
  detached plates. Different materials retain their narrow well-colored separation so
  dense残局 remain readable.
- Every shared unit boundary remains visibly divided by one engraved two-tone seam.
  The material-edge groove is 0.85–1.35 px at 58–76% alpha; a 0.45–0.8 px lower/right
  lip uses `innerEdge` at 22–34% alpha. Seams cover the complete shared edge exactly
  once, never open through to the board well, and never become four complete cell
  outlines.
- Spacing establishes the hierarchy: separate material components retain a board-well
  channel at least 1.6 times the perceived width of an internal engraved seam. The
  external channel is therefore read before the finer internal division. Active and
  Next pieces use their exact canonical four-cell component; authored Puzzle source
  pieces already remain separate same-material components by contract.
- Depth uses one consistent top-left light direction at two scales. The joined outer
  perimeter uses a 1–1.6 px light top/left and dark bottom/right bevel. Each unit face
  adds an inset 1–2.25 px light top/left and dark bottom/right chamfer over the joined
  base, so cells are readable as shallow raised facets within one piece. There is no
  white specular bar, thick lower lip, emboss texture, glow, blur, glass, detached
  shadow, universal black stroke, or plastic/candy gloss.
- Active and Next pieces group their exact four canonical cells. Active replaces the
  locked outer contour with one higher-contrast signal contour; it never adds a second
  perimeter. Locked-board grouping joins only orthogonally adjacent cells with the
  same material. Authored Puzzle setup guarantees those initial same-material
  components are exact source tetrominoes; later line clears may naturally split a
  contour and same-material contacts may naturally merge it without changing Core.
- Ghost uses zero fill and one complete 1 px signal outline around the whole active
  tetromino perimeter at about 45% alpha. Its shared cell boundaries remain as one
  lower-alpha guide per seam, but they do not close into four independent boxes. The
  lock response remains an 80–100 ms low-alpha face change and never draws a second
  outer border.
- Board, Next, canonical silhouettes, active cells, and locked cells use the same
  exact material mapping and cohesive component principle. Board and Next share the
  same Pixi group primitive. The silhouette keeps at most one path per piece type,
  substantially closes the old per-cell gaps, and uses only a hairline seam so the
  tetromino geometry reads before the individual grid units.
- The coordinated mineral mapping below deliberately differs from the standard
  commercial piece-color assignment. Garnet, sea-pine, ochre, storm blue, moss,
  rock violet, and lake blue share one restrained value/chroma envelope; no one piece
  becomes a fluorescent or candy accent.

| Piece | Fill start | Fill end | Edge | Inner edge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I | `#C85A72` | `#B14F65` | `#713443` | `#E69AAA` |
| O | `#47AAA1` | `#3C918A` | `#245B57` | `#91D4CF` |
| T | `#C58E4A` | `#AD783D` | `#694824` | `#E8BD83` |
| S | `#647BC0` | `#576DAE` | `#354675` | `#A9B7E3` |
| Z | `#83AA57` | `#6F914A` | `#425A2B` | `#BCD79A` |
| J | `#9A65B1` | `#87579E` | `#553663` | `#CFA9DC` |
| L | `#4D91AD` | `#407D99` | `#295567` | `#95C8D9` |
- Every fill endpoint has at least 3:1 non-text contrast against the `#0B1726` board
  well; the measured range is 3.34:1–6.74:1.
  Active/locked distinction cannot depend
  on glow or color alone.
- Board and Next reuse the exact drawing primitive. Page entrance is 180 ms over at
  most 4 px; line clear is one local 120–160 ms tonal sweep. No ornamental animation
  loops, and reduced motion removes positional and sweep transitions immediately.

## Information architecture

### Mode home

- The webpage opens on a dedicated mode home with no gameplay board.
- The mode home and Puzzle library do not mount a runtime or canvas. Entering a run
  creates one runtime/canvas; returning home destroys both before showing the home.
- A compact `Tetris` header and one `选择模式` heading lead directly to `经典`, Survival,
  and Puzzle. There is no poetic or marketing hero.
- The three entrances share one continuous 1+2 mode surface: Classic occupies the
  complete first row, with Survival and Puzzle as two independent complete buttons in the
  second row. One-pixel dividers and selected-state tone establish grouping; they are
  not three floating cards or a settings list.
- Every mode entrance keeps its complete action label and rounded arrow control inside
  the shared surface at all required viewports. In particular, 844 × 390 DPR3 must
  satisfy `scrollWidth <= clientWidth` for each mode button and action cluster; the
  right edge may not be hidden by the surface's clipping boundary.
- The standalone selected-mode preview pane and its explanatory copy are removed. A
  small original four-cell signal may live inside a mode entrance, uses the same
  matte-plate language, and never becomes a logo or looping hero.
- Visible home copy is frozen to `Tetris`, one `选择模式`, the three Chinese mode
  names, and these terse factual lines: Classic `分数 · 消行 · 连消`, Survival
  `每 5 行 · 基岩上升`, and Puzzle `15 关残局 · 清空棋盘`, plus `开始` / `选关`.
  `当前选择`, `三种玩法`, `随时开始，也可随时退出。`, `键盘与触控均可操作`,
  full-sentence rule explanations, decorative numbering, and redundant brand labels
  are removed from the visible home.
- Mode selection is not a small rail beside the board.

### Puzzle library

- Every level entry is enabled and shows only its ordinal, name, and optional
  completion status.
- It does not show numeric difficulty or lock state.
- The library is one continuous surface with fifteen complete enabled entries and one
  selected-level detail/start region. Desktop and 844 × 390 use a 3 × 5 matrix plus
  the existing right-side detail. At 360/390 widths the level matrix uses two columns
  and the selected detail stays in normal flow outside the level items. Library-page
  scrolling is allowed on narrow portrait; gameplay page scrolling is not. No layout
  is a pile of floating cards, pagination, or a difficulty/unlock ladder.
- If a level silhouette is shown, it is read-only derived from the existing canonical
  initial board as one SVG with at most one bounded path per piece type. It is not a
  DOM gameplay grid and must not duplicate or modify Puzzle definitions.
- No sticky or fixed selection panel may cover a level row. Visible library copy is
  only `Tetris`, `解谜`, back, ordinals, level names/completion, one selected-board
  silhouette, `目标  清空棋盘`, and `开始`.
- Remove the repeated row-level `清空棋盘`, the library explanation paragraph,
  `当前选择`, visible `起始棋盘`, `连续七袋方块 · 不限定唯一解法`, and the separate
  `方块` / `规则` definition rows. Full accessible labels may still describe controls
  and state without duplicating that prose visually.
- Starting a level must keep the visible selection, canonical `puzzleId`, level seed,
  active piece, and Next preview aligned.

### Game screen

- Top actions provide mode-home exit, current mode, and pause.
- Desktop uses one coherent game surface: the board is the dominant element and one
  flat 200–240 px information dock contains Next, statistics, and compact keyboard
  controls. It does not return to detached side cards.
- Mobile uses a compact information band above the board and a five-action deck below.
- The five actions belong to one integrated control deck with shared edges and clear
  pressed/focus state, not five floating pills or tiles.
- The visible focus ring maps to the board frame rather than outlining the full-page
  Pixi canvas. The canvas may still cover the complete arena so it can render both the
  board and Next against DOM geometry anchors.
- Pixi owns both the dark Next well and its exact canonical tetromino. The DOM
  `next-slot` is a transparent geometry anchor only; an opaque compact information
  band must sit below that canvas layer so it cannot mask the preview on mobile.
- Pause, exit confirmation, success, and failure use accessible light action sheets
  with buttons at least 44 × 44 CSS px.
- Survival shows score, lines, and bedrock height. Puzzle shows level name, cleared lines,
  placed pieces, the board-empty goal, and one Next item. It never shows a finite
  remaining-piece value or a suggested solution.
- Statistic borders are role-based, never inferred from generic odd/even item rules.
  On the desktop Puzzle dock, the level and objective span both columns and the
  placed/cleared pair shares the middle row. Every internal separator is continuous;
  a half-width dangling line, stray vertical segment, or empty fake quadrant is a
  rendering defect. Compact grids may rearrange the same values only when their
  complete row/column boundaries remain visually coherent. Every statistic article
  exposes an explicit semantic role, and all grid spans/dividers select those roles;
  `nth-child`, `nth-of-type`, `odd`, and `even` are forbidden for statistic geometry.
- Remove visible `本局数据`, long `.mode-rule` explanations, and explanatory pause or
  exit paragraphs. Result copy is limited to `棋盘已清空` plus `X 方块 · Y 消行`,
  `堆叠到顶`, or `生存结束` plus the necessary statistics. Mode/level name, back,
  pause, score/statistics, objective, Next, keyboard map, and the five touch labels
  remain visible.

## Responsive and accessibility contract

- All visible buttons are at least 44 × 44 CSS px; primary mobile controls target
  48 px or larger.
- Canvas focus has a visible 3 px high-contrast focus ring.
- Dialog-like sheets expose a readable title, correct role/label, intentional initial
  focus, Escape/cancel behavior, and focus restoration.
- Mode and state are never communicated by color alone.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is honored initially and when the media query changes.
  Runtime changes use `GameRuntime.setReducedMotion` and do not rebuild or replace the
  current canonical game state.
- Required viewports: 1440 × 900, 2048 × 1152, 390 × 844 DPR3, 844 × 390 DPR3, and
  360 × 800.
- Mobile visible body copy and touch labels are at least 12 px, statistic labels at
  least 14 px, and statistic values at least 18 px.
- No horizontal overflow, clipped essential text, overlapping modules, or accidental
  gameplay page scroll.
- At 360 × 800, Puzzle statistics show the complete visible goal `清空棋盘`; it may not
  be ellipsized, clipped, or made to fit by shrinking the value below 18 px. A narrow
  override may redistribute the two statistic columns while preserving their shared
  surface and the 390 × 844 / 844 × 390 layouts.
- Generated JSON and checksum evidence uses explicit LF bytes before hashing so every
  entry in `SHA256SUMS.txt` matches the corresponding raw Git blob on Windows and
  non-Windows checkouts.

## Implementation ownership and sequence

1. Coordinator freezes this contract and exact path boundaries.
2. Puzzle Slice J replaces all fifteen boards with frozen legal zero-clear setup
   histories, regenerates thirty routes/references, and changes no frontend path.
3. If the signed references invalidate an internal browser-QA replay, Slice J-R may
   replace only that replay's frozen placement fixture and its direct test. This is a
   QA-fixture migration: it does not change Puzzle rules, runtime timing, or product
   behavior, and the fixture remains public-command-only.
4. Independent read-only Core/runtime QA verifies the exact Slice J candidate range.
5. Frontend Slice K owns the `暮海矿物` theme, matte renderer, reduced visible copy,
   and related presentation tests. It changes no Core definition or reference.
6. Coordinator runs one combined final typecheck, full suite, build, and browser pass
   after the last product change.
7. Independent read-only functional and visual QA verify the exact combined candidate
   before evidence, changelog integration, or push.

Historical T3/T4 evidence stays unchanged. New reference and browser evidence lives
only under `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-*` and `docs/qa/evidence/tetris-t5`.

## Acceptance gates

- `npm.cmd run typecheck`;
- complete Vitest suite;
- production build;
- deterministic Survival replay proving the fifth cleared line raises one permanent
  bedrock row, later thresholds accumulate, bedrock never clears, and overflow ends
  the run;
- all fifteen Puzzle levels, two distinct successful public-command routes per level,
  restart/hash determinism, normal automatic gravity, grounded locking, continuous
  seven-bag replenishment, consecutive multi-piece play, and exact regeneration from
  legal zero-clear setup histories;
- each setup replay uses public commands from an empty canonical board, derives every
  landing row by hard drop, preserves each source owner as four canonical cells, and
  proves initial cell type/color equals source tetromino type with no random per-cell
  recoloring;
- first-84-piece seven-bag integrity for every level seed with no queue exhaustion or
  budget terminal;
- UI-driven evidence selects modes and levels through visible controls;
- plain-text `Tetris` is the only visible brand; `青流方阵`, `AQUA ROUTE`, blueprint
  coordinates, technical column labels, grids, ticks, scanlines, clipped corners,
  route decoration, stepped bands, ceramic/jelly cells, and toy visuals are absent;
- all three mode entries are visible without scroll at 1440 × 900 and 390 × 844;
- the home is one coherent 1+2 mode surface and the `phase seam` is its only
  ornamental motion;
- the mobile Puzzle selector has no overlay covering any level content;
- coordinated deep mineral matte minos, clearly divided raised unit facets, zero-fill
  whole-silhouette Ghost with internal guides, and Next share one drawing primitive;
  rejected detached tiles, bright plastic, blurred aura, double outer outline,
  toy/candy, cut-corner, ceramic, highlight-bar, thick-lip, and bracket-ghost styles
  are absent;
- the page uses the exact `雾昼矿物` solid tokens, no backdrop blur, ambient color
  blobs, gradient CTA, glow shadow, or page gradient outside the single phase seam;
- visible home/library/game copy matches the frozen minimal lists above. Repeated
  gameplay explanations and the banned strings `当前选择`, `三种玩法`,
  `随时开始，也可随时退出。`, `键盘与触控均可操作`, `本局数据`, and the long
  library/rule descriptions are absent;
- player-facing copy contains no legacy `路线`; use `解法`, `本局`, or `对局` only when
  that meaning is actually needed;
- computed mobile body, statistic, and touch-label sizes are recorded by browser
  evidence rather than inferred only from CSS declarations;
- the complete 360 × 800 Puzzle goal text `清空棋盘` is visibly present and its rendered value
  has `scrollWidth <= clientWidth` without lowering the 18 px statistic-value floor;
- at least one Puzzle scenario after three consecutive locks, with visible/canonical
  level, active piece, placed-piece count, and Next preview aligned;
- mode-home → game → mode-home → game proof with no canvas/ticker/listener leaks;
- direct regression proof that nested mutation of every DEV QA state snapshot leaves
  canonical runtime state unchanged;
- one gameplay canvas, zero gameplay DOM cells, zero console/page errors;
- keyboard, touch, pause/resume, restart, explicit exit, failure, success, and reduced
  motion verified at required viewports.

A nonblank screenshot, internal QA state injection, mock terminal state, copied level
layout, or copied frontend treatment is not acceptance evidence.

## T26 portable RC evidence and version contract

The final TetraMorph RC is versioned `1.0.0-rc.1` in both npm metadata files. Release
evidence must be reproducible from a normal clone: Playwright is a pinned development
dependency, capture scripts import it by package name, and their instructions name the
one-time Chromium installation prerequisite. No committed release runner may contain a
personal home-directory path, Codex skill-cache path, or coordinator-specific username.

Phase-E lifecycle and Phase-F showcase evidence must be regenerated after the metadata
and runner correction so their source SHA, browser audit, screenshots, and cleanup
claims bind to the corrected candidate. Final acceptance additionally requires a clean
install from the committed lockfile, the full project gates, scoped dependency and
secret scans, synchronized status documents, and an independent read-only QA pass on
the exact frozen range.
