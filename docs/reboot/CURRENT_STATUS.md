# Current Project Status

Status: Phase A recursive-foundation rebuild authorized after the design reboot.
The D0 repository-contract slice is independently accepted and integrated. The
I1 gameplay/core interface-bridge half is the only production slice that may
start after the accepted D0 baseline is pushed. The user assesses the overall
target as less than 10% complete.

`Stage 6` is a historical implementation label only. It does not mean that the
visual design, recursive rules, gameplay depth, runtime stability, content, or
playability has reached Stage 6-level completeness or release readiness.

The current workspace is runnable as a React/Vite/PixiJS v8 visual-spatial
prototype backed by a deterministic TypeScript recursive gameplay kernel, an
event-driven animation pipeline, and metric-driven PixiJS renderer alignment.
It intentionally contains no React gameplay UI, level packs, level editor,
menus, polish UI, large content, or new gameplay rules.

## Current Workspace

- Current branch: `main`
- Implementation files in the working tree: Stage 6 renderer fidelity alignment
  plus prior renderer/prototype/kernel stages
- Required records in the working tree: present
- Draft approval documents in the working tree:
  - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`
  - `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Approval status: R1 and D0 documentation contracts accepted. I1 is the only
  active implementation authorization; historical Stage numbers are not
  current authority.
- Local cleanup state: no generated build output retained; dev server stopped

## Preserved Records

- `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

## Do Not Continue

Do not continue future work from:

- `feature/recursive-box-lab`
- `reboot/parabox-worldline-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`

Those branches represent failed implementation rounds. The next attempt should
start from a fresh plan and should not copy implementation files from either
failed round.

## Current Gate

The user explicitly requested continued frontend and game-engine development on
2026-07-11, with repository contracts written first. `AGENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`,
and `CURRENT_TASK.md` now define the active authority, design target, exact
slice order, ownership, and QA gates.

The dependency order is D0 documentation, I1 shared public-interface bridge,
independent QA-I1, C1 deterministic core safety, independent QA-C1, then V1
occurrence-address projection and unified visual completion ownership. V2-V4
frontend completion and later gameplay/content slices require fresh bounded
authorization recorded in `CURRENT_TASK.md`.

Do not treat this authorization as permission for overlapping workstreams,
large content, copied assets, unreviewed schema, or a one-shot rewrite. No
production source change begins until D0 is accepted and pushed.
