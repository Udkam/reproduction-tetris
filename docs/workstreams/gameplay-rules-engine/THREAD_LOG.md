# Recursive Gameplay Rules and Engine Thread Log

## 2026-07-11 - Audit and clean-room rules proposal

- Thread ID: `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`
- Coordinator thread ID: `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Timestamp: 2026-07-11, Asia/Shanghai
- Base commit: `3b23df3be86df568d5aa6a0bef7e1652ff502ef0`
- Coordinator revision consumed (read only; not merged/rebased):
  `ab58d7578d5cb2ef6f59ac7cde325a9cd175b9ef`

### Decisions and evidence

- First phase remains audit/design only. No production TypeScript, renderer,
  level, root changelog, push, merge, or rebase change is authorized.
- Read the shared handoff, `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`,
  `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/recursive-box-lab/GAME_RULES.md`, current QA
  records, all core/projection/runtime/animation modules, and every existing
  local workstream log (none existed in this baseline).
- Consumed the coordinator protocol and coordinator log from `ab58d75` with
  `git show`; see `docs/workstreams/README.md` and
  `docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md` in that commit.
- Read peer thread status by authoritative ID before making dependency notes:
  frontend `019f4e80-145a-7520-81e1-41a45b2bec13`, level design
  `019f4e80-145c-7b53-b675-44b03aa4f625`, and independent QA
  `019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c`. At audit time each was active and
  had no completed peer-log commit to consume.
- Primary research used the official Steam page and official custom-level
  documentation. The latter makes interaction priority, enter/exit, recursive
  references, and load diagnostics explicit evidence; no original code, asset,
  level, text, or format is copied.
- The audit identifies four pre-feature blockers: unsafe `Enter` semantics,
  hard-coded `container-b` interaction/camera paths, visual lock ending before
  the independent recursive camera timeline, and entity-ID-only projection
  interpolation.

### Files changed

- `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/RULES_ENGINE_AUDIT.md`
- `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`

### Commands, tests, and screenshots

- Read-only source and contract audit with `rg`, explicit UTF-8 PowerShell
  reads, `git show`, and the Codex thread-read tool.
- `npm.cmd ci --ignore-scripts`: failed before installation because
  `package-lock.json` is out of sync with `package.json`; it lacks
  `@emnapi/core@1.11.1` and `@emnapi/runtime@1.11.1`. This is a baseline
  reproducibility blocker, not a repaired dependency change in this worktree.
- No browser session or screenshot was required for this rule-engine audit;
  runtime timing evidence was established by static inspection of the 560 ms
  event plan and the independent 980 ms recursive transition timeline.

### Commit

- Pending documentation-only commit.

### Dependencies, blockers, and handoff notes

- The coordinator must approve one bounded slice before production code starts.
- The lockfile must be repaired before the full automated suite can be used as
  a clean-install gate.
- Level-schema/campaign work depends on the approved acyclic rules contract.
- Deeper recursion and self-containment depend on address-aware locations and
  addressed projection/events; the current `worldId` location model is not
  sufficient.
- After committing, report the SHA and this log path to coordinator thread
  `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`; route the SHA to independent QA
  thread `019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c` through the coordinator.

## 2026-07-11 - P0 toolchain reproducibility candidate

- Thread ID: `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`
- Coordinator thread ID: `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Timestamp: 2026-07-11, Asia/Shanghai
- Candidate base: `175ca5e3b251c0485f9603925b0cfda221c11aa1`
- Authorization: exactly one P0 lockfile candidate. Allowed paths are
  `package-lock.json` and this log only; `package.json`, `src/**`, toolchain
  configuration, declared dependency versions, root changelog, push, and merge
  remain forbidden.

### Coordination and independent evidence consumed

- QA artifact commit read with `git show`:
  `7a99506db46b54131b89473b67a86b5d5675577d`.
- Its coordinator integration read with `git show`:
  `c781c310e9ac68015dcff2ace9935472b56bb877`.
- Level-design handoff range read with `git show`:
  `42f9ca197905e3363551c25e91faa8a6ed25527e..fa4d0ef1906098a332e515ba96cede5f600ac4f7`.
  It confirms level content remains blocked on accepted gameplay semantics and
  schema work.
- Latest coordinator P0 decision consumed, read only with `git show`:
  `715b0397d94674f98b24bd544056819e8ead5607`.
- QA and coordinator both retain the Stage 6 release rejection. This candidate
  only closes the reproducibility gate if independent QA accepts it; it does
  not approve sequence item 2 or any product/rules/frontend/level work.

### Repair and verification evidence

- Environment: Node `v24.12.0`; npm `11.6.2`.
- Clean precondition: `Test-Path node_modules` returned `False`; the pre-repair
  `package-lock.json` SHA-256 was
  `FBE0A139404359861B88C6FF1C850BD9AA6753C8ACE6594C682A29C47D26DDD7`.
- Repair command:
  `npm.cmd install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`.
  It changed only `package-lock.json`, adding the missing nested
  `@emnapi/core@1.11.1` and `@emnapi/runtime@1.11.1` entries required by the
  locked `@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi` package. No `node_modules` directory
  was created by this metadata-only command and `package.json` had no diff.
- Clean-install proof:
  `npm.cmd ci --no-audit --no-fund` from the absent-`node_modules`
  precondition; passed and added 64 packages.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`; passed (`tsc --noEmit`).
- `npm.cmd run test`; passed: 9 files / 35 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build`; passed. Vite built production assets successfully and
  emitted only its existing chunk-size advisory for a 520.27 kB minified chunk.
- `git diff --check`; passed. Before staging, `git status --short` showed only
  `M package-lock.json` and `M docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`;
  `git diff --name-only` listed exactly those two paths, and
  `git diff -- package.json` was empty.
- Scoped staging command:
  `git add -- package-lock.json docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`.
  `git diff --cached --name-only` listed exactly
  `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md` and
  `package-lock.json`; `git diff --cached --check` passed.
- Post-repair hashes: `package.json` SHA-256 remains
  `B6863FB4D1699C81466D5ECD9E4B506923C4736F3A2A78E3E4064D1977D6B3B3`;
  `package-lock.json` SHA-256 is now
  `C4C47BA150EE1F308301FBD2CD4BFDFB121641B2581FDC443B0AA00732FE7E80`.

### Candidate scope and handoff

- Files changed by this candidate:
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`
- Production behavior, declared dependency ranges, source code, and toolchain
  configuration are unchanged.
- Commit: pending final scoped staging and commit.
- Send the resulting SHA and this log path to coordinator
  `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331` and independent QA
  `019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c`. Await their decision before starting
  any rules/runtime stability work.

## 2026-07-11 - R1 Contract Freeze (documentation only)

- Thread ID: `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`
- Coordinator thread ID: `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Timestamp: 2026-07-11, Asia/Shanghai
- Worktree base: `86d02d4498d314fcda9a8d7608509b4e5ba18ca1`
- Authorization: exactly one documentation-only R1 slice. Allowed paths are
  `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/RULES_SLICE_R1_CONTRACT.md` and this
  log only. Production code, package/configuration files, frontend, levels,
  serialization, root changelog, push, and merge remain forbidden.

### Revisions and research consumed read-only

- Coordinator/P0 authority: `218bade` via
  `git show 218bade:docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md`.
- Independent QA/P0 authority: `1fb6c32` via
  `git show 1fb6c32:docs/workstreams/qa-approval/THREAD_LOG.md`.
- Authoritative user scope clarification: `f4f3433` via
  `git show f4f3433:docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md` and
  `git show f4f3433:docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md`. It confirms
  the project is less than 10% complete, Stage 6 is historical only, and this
  design-reboot round permits no production work without a later explicit user
  development instruction plus a new bounded coordinator authorization.
- Canonical planning documents were read from `218bade`, including this
  workstream's integrated `RULES_ENGINE_AUDIT.md` and log. The canonical audit
  remains the planning baseline, accepted only as planning direction.
- Non-authoritative delayed research commit
  `d5c36246c59ae9d96525543c0b93fc149db80a15` was read with `git show` for
  `RULES_CONTRACT.md` only. Its duplicate `THREAD_LOG.md` was neither read as
  authority nor copied, merged, or replaced.

### Decisions

- P0's clean-install acceptance does not release Stage 6 or authorize any
  source change. R1 freezes documentation before a separate C1 core-safety
  request can be considered; after QA review, this workstream stops until the
  later explicit user/coordinator development authorization arrives.
- R1 defines center-anchor, exactly-one port mapping; full discriminated
  command/attempt/transaction/event/address shapes; complete
  `cycleMode: "forbid"` enforcement; and a fixed 1,000-sequence stress
  protocol.
- R1 assigns C1 core safety and later V1 runtime/render occurrence-address and
  visual-lock work to disjoint file/test sets. V1 consumes C1 semantics and
  cannot silently rewrite them.
- The delayed duplicate supplied useful research but conflicts on authority,
  severity, initial cycle policy, and `not-applicable` semantics. R1 retains
  QA-mandated `cycleMode: "forbid"` and canonical workstream ownership.

### Files changed

- `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/RULES_SLICE_R1_CONTRACT.md`
- `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`

### Commands, tests, and handoff

- Read-only evidence commands: `git show` for `218bade`, `1fb6c32`, canonical
  workstream documents, and delayed research `d5c3624`; no merge or rebase.
- This slice changes no executable code. Verification is scoped to Markdown
  content, allowed paths, `git diff --check`, and final staged-path review;
  no product test run is claimed as R1 evidence.
- Commit: pending scoped documentation-only verification and commit.
- Send the resulting SHA and this log path to coordinator and independent QA;
  await QA before requesting C1. No code follows from R1 automatically.

## 2026-07-11 - R1 conditional-reject contract correction

- Thread ID: `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`
- Coordinator thread ID: `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Candidate under correction: `87dfa4517ca668e09e97161405b39949939f2252`
- QA verdict: conditional reject. The independent QA thread
  `019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c` identified three contract blockers;
  coordinator authorized exactly one follow-up documentation-only correction.

### Bounded correction decisions

- Split public-result and stress-oracle invariants by command family. A rejected
  `Step` now has a nonempty ordered attempt trace ending in terminal `blocked`;
  rejected `Undo`/`Redo`/`Reset` now explicitly use `attempts: []` and exactly
  one deterministic `command-blocked` event with frozen code/reason shape.
  Initial history/reset cases are explicit in the stress domain.
- Freeze the complete prioritized R1 rule set (`push`, `enter`, `exit`) with a
  complete enablement map. `interactionPriority` must contain every and only
  enabled rule once. After all enabled rules are not applicable, `Step` emits
  terminal `step-fallback` / `no-enabled-rule-applies`; it cannot fall through
  without a public result.
- Freeze exit selection against declared `CellAddress` semantics: resolve the
  actor address to canonical `worldId`, then compare exact `worldId/x/y` to the
  port landing. Duplicate `(innerWorldId, x, y)` landing cells are forbidden
  across all ports, leaving ambiguity only as defensive invalid-data handling.
- Performed a normative consistency pass across port validation, result/event
  shapes, stress fixtures/oracles, failure expectations, C1/V1 ownership, and
  R1 acceptance criteria. No product or implementation authority is created.

### Files and verification

- Allowed changed paths only:
  - `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/RULES_SLICE_R1_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`
- This is contract repair only. No source, package, configuration, QA file,
  root changelog, test run, merge, rebase, or push is permitted or claimed.
- Required pre-commit checks: exact path scope, `git diff --check`, and
  `git show --check` after committing.
- Commit: pending one scoped follow-up documentation commit. Report its SHA to
  coordinator and independent QA, then stop; a conditional-reject repair does
  not authorize C1, V1, Stage 6, release, or production development.
