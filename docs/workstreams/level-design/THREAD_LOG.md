  screenshots, root changelog edits, push, merge, or self-approval.

## 2026-07-11 — Initial Audit And Tutorial Proposal

### Coordination Evidence Consumed

- Coordinator protocol and log read from commit ab58d75:
  - docs/workstreams/README.md
  - docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md
- Peer statuses were read by authoritative thread ID before recording
  dependencies:
  - Gameplay Rules and Engine: 019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f
  - Frontend Visual Design: 019f4e80-145a-7520-81e1-41a45b2bec13
  - Independent QA: 019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c
- All three peers were still in their initial active audit turn and exposed no
  committed log/proposal SHA. No peer implementation or uncommitted worktree
  file was treated as an authoritative dependency decision.

### Decisions

- Proposed a compact original four-level tutorial: Through the Frame, Both Rooms
  Count, Move the Window, and A Room Within.
- The teaching order is entry/exit, multi-world goals, container movement, then
  two-level nesting. Push-in, push-out, cycles, multi-entrance routing, and
  cross-boundary object transfer are excluded.
- Defined uniqueness as one minimum irreversible milestone plan rather than one
  raw keystroke sequence; walking detours and undo/redo loops are normalized.
- Kept the proposal intentionally above grid coordinates and serialization
  syntax. It contains no src/levels directory, sample JSON, schema field names,
  or production code.

### Evidence Reviewed

- Shared handoff:
  C:\Users\Alex Chen\AppData\Local\Temp\codex-handoff-game1-20260711-080600.md
- Contracts: ARCHITECTURE.md, DESIGN_REFERENCE.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md,
  docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md, docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md, and
  docs/recursive-box-lab/GAME_RULES.md.
- Core contracts: src/core/types.ts, commands.ts, reducer.ts,
  recursiveTransitions.ts, worldGraph.ts, movementResolver.ts, replay.ts,
  win.ts, systems.ts, core.test.ts, and replay.test.ts.
- Runtime/projection contracts: src/runtime/GameRuntime.ts,
  src/runtime/InteractionPrototype.ts, and
  src/projection/simulationProjection.ts.
- Stage evidence: docs/qa/STAGE4_PLAYABLE_CORE.md and
  docs/qa/STAGE6_RENDER_ALIGNMENT.md.

### Findings

- src/levels is absent. GameRuntime builds the hard-coded
  createStage3BSimulationState() fixture.
- Enter(containerId) currently requires only that actor and container share the
  active world; it does not require adjacency/contact. Entrance selection uses
  a fixed first-available ordering.
- Recursive input toggles hard-coded container-b rather than selecting a
  level-derived target.
- Projection defaults to depth two and core palettes contain two IDs. The
  fourth tutorial needs later approved data/render staging before visual
  acceptance.
- Existing core supports deterministic state hashes, replay command arrays,
  container movement with retained child-world identity, and multi-world goal
  checking. These findings support the teaching order, not content creation.

### Changed Files

- docs/workstreams/level-design/LEVEL_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md
- docs/workstreams/level-design/THREAD_LOG.md

### Commands And Tests

- Memory lookup for prior Game-1 Stage 6 renderer evidence: completed.
- Shared handoff, contracts, source, Stage 4/6 QA, and Git history audit:
  completed with explicit UTF-8 reads.
- Test-Path src/levels: False.
- Test-Path docs/workstreams/level-design/THREAD_LOG.md before creation: False.
- Coordinator evidence:
  git show ab58d75:docs/workstreams/README.md
  git show ab58d75:docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md
  completed.
- npm.cmd run typecheck: blocked before TypeScript ran because local tsc is not
  installed in this isolated worktree.
- npm.cmd run test: blocked before Vitest ran because local vitest is not
  installed in this isolated worktree.
- npm.cmd run build: blocked at its typecheck prerequisite for the same missing
  tsc executable.
- No dependency installation was attempted for this documentation-only audit;
  it would not validate the proposal and could obscure the independent QA
  workstream's lockfile baseline findings.
- git diff --check returned successfully before staging.
- Explicit staging was limited to the two listed workstream documents; staged
  git diff --cached --check passed and Git reports no other changed paths.
- Final documentation-only commit: pending.

### Screenshots

- None. This proposal-only slice made no visual or production-code change.

### Commit

- 42f9ca197905e3363551c25e91faa8a6ed25527e
  docs: add level design audit proposal
- Reported to coordinator thread 019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331 with
  this log path and the open dependency set.

### Dependencies And Blockers

- Gameplay Rules and Engine must approve entry, entrance, exit, focused-container
  movement, completion-event, and excluded-mechanic semantics before level
  fixture authoring.
- Level Serialization must approve the schema, validator, and replay boundary.
- Frontend Visual Design must define palette/camera/responsive screenshot
  constraints before visual acceptance.
- Independent QA reviews this workstream commit by SHA; this workstream does
  not self-approve.

### Handoff Notes

- The worktree contains proposal/log artifacts only and must not be rebased or
  merged with coordinator commit ab58d75 during this audit phase.
- Await coordinator approval before implementing any production or level slice.

## 2026-07-11 — Coordinator P0 Decision Consumed

### Coordination Evidence Consumed

- Coordinator decision revision 715b039:
  - docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md
  - docs/workstreams/qa-approval/QA_APPROVAL_RUBRIC.md

### Decision Recorded

- Stage 6 is rejected for release.
- The accepted QA baseline keeps all rules/runtime, frontend, level
  serialization, and level-content implementation frozen.
- Only the Gameplay Rules and Engine workstream has a bounded P0 authorization,
  limited to package-lock.json and its own THREAD_LOG.md. This workstream has
  no authorization to modify that candidate.
- The level-design proposal remains provisional and blocked on accepted
  gameplay semantics, schema validation/replay, frontend staging, and
  independent QA by candidate SHA.

### Changed Files

- docs/workstreams/level-design/THREAD_LOG.md

### Commands And Tests

- git show 715b039:docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md: completed.
- git show 715b039:docs/workstreams/qa-approval/QA_APPROVAL_RUBRIC.md:
  completed.
- No production, level, renderer, frontend, package, or lockfile command was
  run for this documentation acknowledgment.

### Screenshots

- None.

### Dependencies And Blockers

- P0 lockfile reproducibility must close before any broader candidate can be
  accepted.
- No level-design follow-up is authorized until the coordinator and independent
  QA open a bounded slice.

### Handoff Notes

- Do not rebase or merge coordinator main revision 715b039 into this isolated
  worktree during the current audit turn.
