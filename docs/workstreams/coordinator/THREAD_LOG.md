# Coordinator Thread Log

## 2026-07-11 - Multi-thread workstream initialization

- Thread ID: `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Deep link: `codex://threads/019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Role: planning, cross-thread coordination, integration, changelog
  consolidation, and final acceptance only.
- Baseline: `3b23df3 stage 6: renderer fidelity alignment` on `main` and
  `origin/main`.

Decisions:

- Preserve the viable React/PixiJS/canonical-state/projection foundation.
- Treat the current output as a technical prototype, not gameplay-ready work.
- Allow evidence-backed partial redesign of visual presentation, gameplay depth,
  recursive rules, and their runtime integration.
- Do not proceed directly to level serialization before the Stage 6.5 rules,
  runtime-stability, and visual-fidelity gates are resolved.
- Split work into frontend design, recursive gameplay rules/engine, level design,
  and independent QA/approval workstreams.
- Use isolated worktrees, thread IDs as identifiers, separate logs, and commit
  SHAs for cross-worktree exchange.
- Reserve the root `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` for coordinator-authored,
  post-integration stage summaries.

Created workstream threads:

- Frontend and visual fidelity: `019f4e80-145a-7520-81e1-41a45b2bec13`.
- Recursive gameplay rules and engine: `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`.
- Level and puzzle design: `019f4e80-145c-7b53-b675-44b03aa4f625`.
- Independent approval and QA: `019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c`.

Thread configuration:

- Model: `gpt-5.6-terra`.
- Reasoning effort: `xhigh`.
- Speed: standard/default.
- First phase: audit and design only; no production implementation before
  coordinator approval.

Shared handoff:

- `C:\Users\Alex Chen\AppData\Local\Temp\codex-handoff-game1-20260711-080600.md`

Next coordinator action:

- Receive each audit/design commit and log.
- Route worker commits to the independent QA thread.
- Approve a dependency-ordered implementation plan before any production-code
  slice begins.

## 2026-07-11 - QA rejection and proposal intake

QA evidence accepted into the coordination baseline:

- QA workstream commit: `7a99506db46b54131b89473b67a86b5d5675577d`.
- Integrated main commit: `c781c31 docs(qa): define Stage 6 approval gates`.
- Artifacts:
  - `docs/workstreams/qa-approval/THREAD_LOG.md`
  - `docs/workstreams/qa-approval/QA_APPROVAL_RUBRIC.md`
- QA verdict: Stage 6 rejected for release; no production implementation slice
  approved.

Coordinator reproduction:

- `npm.cmd ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` exited `1`.
- Reproduced missing lock entries:
  - `@emnapi/core@1.11.1`
  - `@emnapi/runtime@1.11.1`
- `package-lock.json` hash remained
  `b0e0efca49d1371af660b34f17e0832777500954` before and after the dry run.
- No tracked file changed during reproduction.

Gameplay-rules proposal received but not approved:

- Audit/design commit: `175ca5e3b251c0485f9603925b0cfda221c11aa1`.
- The proposal defines an acyclic, address-aware target contract and a
  dependency-ordered stability sequence.
- It has been routed to independent QA by SHA.
- Production rules/runtime work remains frozen; only the bounded P0 lockfile
  candidate below is authorized.

Level-design proposal received but not approved:

- Proposal commit: `42f9ca197905e3363551c25e91faa8a6ed25527e`.
- Handoff-log follow-up: `fa4d0ef1906098a332e515ba96cede5f600ac4f7`.
- The four-level tutorial proposal remains blocked on gameplay semantics,
  serialization, frontend staging, and independent QA review by SHA.

Gate decision:

- Only a package-lock reproducibility candidate may proceed before P0 closes.
- The candidate should change `package-lock.json` plus its workstream
  `THREAD_LOG.md` only. If `package.json`, production source, or a declared
  dependency version must change, the owner must stop and request a revised
  scope.
- Required evidence is a clean `npm ci`, typecheck, 35-or-more passing tests,
  production build, exact staged paths, and unchanged production behavior.
- Rules/runtime production work, frontend production work, level
  serialization, and level content remain frozen until QA accepts the P0
  candidate.
