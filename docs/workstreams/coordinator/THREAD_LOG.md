# Coordinator Thread Log

## 2026-07-11 - Multi-thread workstream initialization

- Thread ID: `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Deep link: `codex://threads/019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`
- Role: planning, cross-thread coordination, integration, changelog
  consolidation, and final acceptance only.
- Baseline: `3b23df3 stage 6: renderer fidelity alignment` on `main` and
  `origin/main`.

Decisions:

- Preserve the viable React/PixiJS/canonical-state/projection foundation.
- Treat the current output as a technical prototype, not gameplay-ready work.
- Allow evidence-backed partial redesign of visual presentation, gameplay depth,
  recursive rules, and their runtime integration.
- Do not proceed directly to level serialization before the Stage 6.5 rules,
  runtime-stability, and visual-fidelity gates are resolved.
- Split work into frontend design, recursive gameplay rules/engine, level design,
  and independent QA/approval workstreams.
- Use isolated worktrees, thread IDs as identifiers, separate logs, and commit
  SHAs for cross-worktree exchange.
- Reserve the root `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` for coordinator-authored,
  post-integration stage summaries.

Created workstream threads:

- Frontend and visual fidelity: `019f4e80-145a-7520-81e1-41a45b2bec13`.
- Recursive gameplay rules and engine: `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`.
- Level and puzzle design: `019f4e80-145c-7b53-b675-44b03aa4f625`.
- Independent approval and QA: `019f4e80-1462-7b32-8146-19ded692836c`.

Thread configuration:

- Model: `gpt-5.6-terra`.
- Reasoning effort: `xhigh`.
- Speed: standard/default.
- First phase: audit and design only; no production implementation before
  coordinator approval.

Shared handoff:

- `C:\Users\Alex Chen\AppData\Local\Temp\codex-handoff-game1-20260711-080600.md`

Next coordinator action:

- Receive each audit/design commit and log.
- Route worker commits to the independent QA thread.
- Approve a dependency-ordered implementation plan before any production-code
  slice begins.

## 2026-07-11 - QA rejection and proposal intake

QA evidence accepted into the coordination baseline:

- QA workstream commit: `7a99506db46b54131b89473b67a86b5d5675577d`.
- Integrated main commit: `c781c31 docs(qa): define Stage 6 approval gates`.
- Artifacts:
  - `docs/workstreams/qa-approval/THREAD_LOG.md`
  - `docs/workstreams/qa-approval/QA_APPROVAL_RUBRIC.md`
- QA verdict: Stage 6 rejected for release; no production implementation slice
  approved.

Coordinator reproduction:

- `npm.cmd ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` exited `1`.
- Reproduced missing lock entries:
  - `@emnapi/core@1.11.1`
  - `@emnapi/runtime@1.11.1`
- `package-lock.json` hash remained
  `b0e0efca49d1371af660b34f17e0832777500954` before and after the dry run.
- No tracked file changed during reproduction.

Gameplay-rules proposal received but not approved:

- Audit/design commit: `175ca5e3b251c0485f9603925b0cfda221c11aa1`.
- The proposal defines an acyclic, address-aware target contract and a
  dependency-ordered stability sequence.
- It has been routed to independent QA by SHA.
- Production rules/runtime work remains frozen; only the bounded P0 lockfile
  candidate below is authorized.

Level-design proposal received but not approved:

- Proposal commit: `42f9ca197905e3363551c25e91faa8a6ed25527e`.
- Handoff-log follow-up: `fa4d0ef1906098a332e515ba96cede5f600ac4f7`.
- The four-level tutorial proposal remains blocked on gameplay semantics,
  serialization, frontend staging, and independent QA review by SHA.

Gate decision:

- Only a package-lock reproducibility candidate may proceed before P0 closes.
- The candidate should change `package-lock.json` plus its workstream
  `THREAD_LOG.md` only. If `package.json`, production source, or a declared
  dependency version must change, the owner must stop and request a revised
  scope.
- Required evidence is a clean `npm ci`, typecheck, 35-or-more passing tests,
  production build, exact staged paths, and unchanged production behavior.
- Rules/runtime production work, frontend production work, level
  serialization, and level content remain frozen until QA accepts the P0
  candidate.

## 2026-07-11 - Planning proposals independently accepted

Independent QA review:

- QA follow-up source commit:
  `b10537e90e869153be0d86d08e9eddddf5356db3`.
- Integrated QA follow-up commit:
  `423fff9 docs(qa): review rules and level proposals`.
- Stage 6 remains rejected for release. The verdicts below accept planning
  direction only and grant no production, serialization, or content authority.

Gameplay-rules planning direction:

- Source proposal: `175ca5e3b251c0485f9603925b0cfda221c11aa1`.
- Integrated commit: `16d26b8 docs: audit recursive gameplay rules engine`.
- QA accepted the acyclic, address-aware direction, typed rejections,
  transactional updates, replay enrichment, and dependency-ordered stability
  sequence as planning guidance.
- Before implementation approval, the contract must define deterministic
  direction-to-port mapping, exact public result/event/address shapes,
  load-time `cycleMode: "forbid"` enforcement, and the seeded/domain-reported
  1,000-sequence stress-test protocol.

Level-design planning direction:

- Source chain:
  - `42f9ca197905e3363551c25e91faa8a6ed25527e`
  - `fa4d0ef1906098a332e515ba96cede5f600ac4f7`
  - `2f421646aea3a24f578d927718d730a30e59cfe8`
- Integrated chain:
  - `dc15913 docs: add level design audit proposal`
  - `6f04174 docs: record level design handoff`
  - `af2cbd6 docs: record coordinator P0 decision`
- QA accepted the four-level campaign as a provisional teaching direction
  only. No schema, coordinates, fixtures, solver claim, or runtime level is
  authorized.
- Before authoring, the workstream must consume accepted rules and
  serialization contracts, formalize solver cost/bounds/milestone
  equivalence, and consume approved frontend desktop/mobile/transition staging
  criteria.

Frontend-design proposal intake:

- Source chain received and routed to independent QA:
  - `2ac2ed058af4ac49d7f5821f64d416b608ed845a`
  - `be0b9e79bb6e84683b4c55b9f1bfad48ac91ca45`
- The frontend proposal is not integrated pending QA verdict.

Active gate:

- P0 lockfile reproducibility remains the only authorized implementation
  candidate.
- All other workstreams remain audit/design-only or idle.

## 2026-07-11 - P0 accepted and planning baseline completed

Independent QA source decision:

- `7e65e33ff44b16755eb5ea48e070691bc265d7a6`.
- Integrated as `1fb6c32 docs(qa): review frontend and P0 lockfile`.
- QA accepted the P0 candidate only and accepted the frontend proposal only as
  planning direction. Stage 6 remains rejected for release and all P1/P2 gates
  remain open.

P0 integration:

- Source candidate: `86d02d4498d314fcda9a8d7608509b4e5ba18ca1`.
- Integrated as `5075df0 build: repair reproducible npm lockfile`.
- Changed production manifest scope: `package-lock.json` only; the accompanying
  gameplay workstream log records the candidate evidence.
- `package.json`, declared dependency ranges, source, config, assets, and root
  changelog are unchanged.

Coordinator combined verification after integration:

- `npm.cmd ci --no-audit --no-fund`: passed; 64 packages installed.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed; 9 files / 35 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed; only the existing 520.27 kB Vite chunk-size
  advisory remains.

Frontend planning integration:

- Source chain:
  - `2ac2ed058af4ac49d7f5821f64d416b608ed845a`
  - `be0b9e79bb6e84683b4c55b9f1bfad48ac91ca45`
- Integrated chain:
  - `9f1d2a1 docs(frontend): audit visual redesign`
  - `2244b95 docs(frontend): record audit handoff`
- Planning direction preserves PixiJS/projection/metrics/procedural foundations
  and proposes a partial reboot of composition, materials, aperture clarity,
  motion continuity, responsive behavior, and performance verification.
- No frontend implementation authority is granted.

Next authorized slice: R1 Contract Freeze (documentation only):

- Owner: gameplay thread `019f4e82-7cb8-73c1-b4a1-d333273b359f`.
- Allowed paths only:
  - `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/RULES_SLICE_R1_CONTRACT.md`
  - `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md`
- The contract must define:
  1. deterministic `Step(direction)` to exactly one port mapping, including
     absent and ambiguous-port rejection;
  2. exact public discriminated result, semantic event, transaction, world
     address, and entity-occurrence address shapes;
  3. load-time `cycleMode: "forbid"` enforcement for every containment edge in
     the first production slice;
  4. a 1,000-sequence deterministic stress protocol with named PRNG, fixed seed,
     command/data domain, invariant oracle, and reproducible failure report;
  5. the path and test ownership boundary between the first core-safety
     implementation and the later runtime/render address-and-lock slice.
- The delayed duplicate proposal `d5c3624` may be read as non-authoritative
  research input but must not be merged or used as a workstream log.
- No `src/**`, package, config, frontend, level, serialization, root changelog,
  push, or merge change is authorized in R1 Contract Freeze.
- Independent QA must review the resulting SHA before any core implementation
  slice is opened.

## 2026-07-11 - User completion and scope clarification

Authoritative user clarification:

- This multi-thread round is a partial reboot of the current design, not a
  continuation claim that Stage 6 is complete.
- The current project is less than 10% complete relative to the intended
  high-fidelity, genuinely playable target.
- `Stage 6` is retained only as a historical commit/artifact label. It must not
  be reported as visual, gameplay, engine, content, or release completion.
- This round remains focused on design restart, contract freezing, audit, and
  risk cleanup.
- Further production development begins only after a later explicit user
  instruction and a new bounded coordinator authorization.

Coordination consequence:

- Workstream reports must distinguish “artifact implemented” from “target
  complete.”
- No percentage or stage-completion claim may be inferred from existing Stage
  numbers, green unit tests, or a nonblank screenshot.
