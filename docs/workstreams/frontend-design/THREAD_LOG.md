## 2026-07-11 — Stage 6 Visual Audit and Redesign Contract

### Coordination and revisions consumed

- Read coordinator protocol and log at `ab58d75` with:
  - `git show ab58d75:docs/workstreams/README.md`
  - `git show ab58d75:docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md`
- Do not merge or rebase `ab58d75` during this audit. The coordinator owns
  integration and `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` consolidation.
- Read latest coordinator decision from `715b039` without rebasing:
  - `git show 715b039:docs/workstreams/coordinator/THREAD_LOG.md`
  - `git show 715b039:docs/workstreams/qa-approval/QA_APPROVAL_RUBRIC.md`
  It records the accepted QA governance integration (`c781c31`), reproduces
  P0 lockfile failure, rejects Stage 6 for release, and freezes all frontend
  implementation. Only the gameplay workstream may make the bounded P0
  package-lock-plus-log candidate.
- Read peer workstream records before making cross-workstream dependency
  recommendations:
  - Level Design range
    `42f9ca197905e3363551c25e91faa8a6ed25527e..fa4d0ef1906098a332e515ba96cede5f600ac4f7`:
    `docs/workstreams/level-design/THREAD_LOG.md` and
    `LEVEL_DESIGN_PROPOSAL.md`.
  - Independent QA `7a99506db46b54131b89473b67a86b5d5675577d`:
    `docs/workstreams/qa-approval/THREAD_LOG.md` and
    `QA_APPROVAL_RUBRIC.md`.
  - Gameplay Rules and Engine `175ca5e3b251c0485f9603925b0cfda221c11aa1`:
    `docs/workstreams/gameplay-rules-engine/THREAD_LOG.md` and
    `RULES_ENGINE_AUDIT.md`.

### Decisions

- Preserve PixiJS canvas ownership, deterministic core/projection separation,
  renderer-owned cell metrics, masked recursive children, procedural art, void
  particles, and command-driven animation.
- Partially reboot composition, material grammar, recursive aperture
  readability, projection-instance addressing, transition lifetime, mobile
  behavior, and active-frame allocation strategy.
- Treat the observed missing middle-frame geometry as a P1 acceptance blocker;
  do not accept a cosmetic renderer pass before generic address/transition-lock
  ownership is resolved.
- Treat clean `npm ci` as an upstream P0 release prerequisite. Temporary
  local dependency installation enabled audit commands only and is not a fix.
- Align future renderer/runtime work with the committed gameplay proposal:
  projection occurrence identity is keyed by addressed path, renderer events
  carry the occurrence route, and one command lock owns entity, camera, and
  portal transitions. No `container-b` hard-coding is acceptable.
- Keep the level workstream's four tutorial visual-staging needs provisional.
  They guide future screenshot needs but do not authorize level data, schema,
  camera metadata, or content.
- Do not implement product code, modify the root changelog, push, merge, or
  self-approve this proposal. Frontend implementation remains frozen until QA
  accepts P0 and the coordinator grants a new bounded approval.

### Evidence reviewed

- Shared handoff: `C:\Users\Alex Chen\AppData\Local\Temp\codex-handoff-game1-20260711-080600.md`.
- Core contracts: `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`,
  `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`,
  `docs/qa/STAGE6_RENDER_ALIGNMENT.md`, and
  `docs/recursive-box-lab/GAME_RULES.md`.
- Renderer/runtime: `src/render/PixiApp.ts`, `Camera2D.ts`,
  `RecursiveTransitionRenderer.ts`, `metrics.ts`, material and primitive
  modules, `src/runtime/GameRuntime.ts`, `InteractionPrototype.ts`, and
  animation/projection modules.
- Existing visual artifact:
  `docs/screenshots/stage6-render-fidelity.png`.
- Official primary references: the official press page and screenshots 1, 2,
  and 8 listed by `DESIGN_REFERENCE.md`. They were inspected as temporary
  external files only and were not copied into the worktree.

### Browser and screenshot evidence

- In-app browser loaded `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` after dependencies were made
  available. Desktop result: one Pixi canvas, zero gameplay DOM nodes, viewport
  `1280x720`, DPR `1.25`, canvas CSS `1280x720`, backing store `1600x900`.
- Browser console check after interaction: zero warning/error entries.
- Resting scene was nonblank and exposes player, normal box, goal, and one
  recursive aperture, but has a single symmetric isolated slab rather than
  deliberate parent-context composition.
- A 70 ms movement capture and a 300 ms enter capture visibly lost the world
  frame, leaving a gray field with only the animated player/aperture. The
  settled frame returned. This is reproducible visual evidence of an incomplete
  transition lifecycle, not a screenshot-only concern.
- Requested `390x844` viewport override was attempted twice, including a fresh
  local tab. Both reported the unchanged `1280x720` viewport/canvas; therefore
  no mobile claim is made. The proposal requires a verified mobile capture
  surface before accepting responsive work.
- No screenshot was committed because this audit changes no local visual output.

### Commands and results

- `python .../webapp-testing/scripts/with_server.py --help`: completed before
  local browser testing.
- `npm.cmd ci`: failed reproducibly because `package-lock.json` lacks
  `@emnapi/core@1.11.1` and `@emnapi/runtime@1.11.1`.
- `npm.cmd install --package-lock=false --no-audit --no-fund`: completed only
  to run local audit tooling; tracked manifests remained unchanged.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck`: passed after temporary installation.
- `npm.cmd run test`: passed, 9 files / 35 tests.
- `npm.cmd run build`: passed after temporary installation.
- `git diff --check`: passed before documentation staging.
- `git status --short`: no tracked source/config change before this proposal.

### Files changed

- `docs/workstreams/frontend-design/VISUAL_REDESIGN_PROPOSAL.md`
- `docs/workstreams/frontend-design/THREAD_LOG.md`

### Commit, dependencies, blockers, and handoff

- Initial documentation-only commit: pending at the time this entry was
  created; the follow-up log entry records its SHA before final handoff.
- Dependencies: generic projection-instance identity and interaction targeting
  from gameplay; schema-approved visual staging from level design; clean
  reproducibility and independent verdict from QA.
- Blockers: lockfile P0, fixed-container/transition-lock P1, unverified mobile
  viewport, and no checked-in deterministic visual-capture tooling.
- Handoff: send the final commit SHA and both workstream document paths to
  coordinator thread `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`; await an explicit
  approved slice before touching production code.
