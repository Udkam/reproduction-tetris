Branch/worktree: `codex/tetris` / `E:\Proj\Game-1`

## 2026-07-14 — T1 implementation handoff

- Scope: remove the generic dashboard treatment, make the player-facing surface concise
  Chinese under the exact title `Tetris`, improve held soft drop and continuous
  presentation, add deterministic Race mode, and add a bounded local leaderboard.
- Ownership: Tetris source, focused tests, browser evidence, `DESIGN.md`,
  `CURRENT_TASK.md`, and Tetris QA documentation. No Temple or archived recursive-game
  implementation was authorized.
- Local implementation result: typecheck passed; Vitest passed 8 files / 41 tests;
  production build passed; one final browser-evidence pass recorded 10 accepted entries.
- Candidate state: implementation complete locally and awaiting coordinator scope review,
  candidate commit, and independent QA. This line is not coordinator acceptance or push.
- Deferred: no additional Tetris features. Any QA finding must be returned as a bounded
  correction to this workstream before integration.
