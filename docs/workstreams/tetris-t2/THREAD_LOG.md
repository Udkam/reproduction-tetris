# Tetris T2 Workstream Log

Workstream owner: `/root`

Coordinator: primary task `019f4deb-7e83-7583-8cd5-8e6f075bc331`

Branch/worktree: `codex/tetris` / `E:\Proj\reproduction-patricks-parabox`

## 2026-07-14 — T2 implementation opened

- Authorized baseline: `0a28a1f4efad72296e46b0a91d859c45cc300edf`, the accepted and pushed
  T1 release.
- Scope: remove Hold end-to-end; distinguish Marathon top-out and score-first rules
  from Race 20-line completion and fixed-tick ranking; build a board-led ready
  surface; version and harden local leaderboard persistence; preserve the accepted
  renderer architecture and input responsiveness.
- Contract state: `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`, and
  `docs/qa/TETRIS_ACCEPTANCE.md` have been updated to **in progress** before source
  work. No completion or verification result is claimed by this entry.
- Boundary: `E:\Proj\reproduction-temple-run` and untracked `docs/screenshots/temple/` are
  explicitly out of scope and must remain untouched.

## 2026-07-14 — Ready visual gate rejected; composition reset in progress

- Coordinator rejected the previous ready composition after screenshot review. Formal
  browser evidence, build, full-suite verification, and commit are paused pending a
  new visual gate.
- Preserved work: Hold removal and the distinct Marathon/Race deterministic rules
  remain in place; this correction is limited to ready-state App, CSS, and renderer
  composition.
- New contract: quiet warm paper with one jade registration line; desktop header plus
  180–220 px mode rail and central board; board-local unboxed ready copy; no ready
  stats, leaderboard, Next, pause, state duplicate, dark modal, cards, mode table,
  or dense explanatory text.
- Mobile contract: two text tabs directly below the header, then the board-local
  ready content without a floating blocker or horizontal overflow.
- Next action: make only 1440 × 900 and 390 × 844 development screenshots with
  structured geometry for coordinator visual review. No formal evidence or commit
  will be produced before approval.

- 2026-07-14: Coordinator pause received. Dirty work is preserved unchanged; no
  further source, visual, verification, evidence, commit, push, or revert action is
  authorized until an approved design artifact SHA/path is supplied.

## 2026-07-14 — D4 production implementation resumed

- Coordinator supplied the approved read-only Offset Drop design artifact
  `7fc81433736e3279f7a7075f0d9054ec31d5c67f` (parent
  `2aea0a0d4a0a33b88f726c76ae1a30ac9276af3`). The design worktree was read only;
  nothing has been cherry-picked or copied as a commit.
- Root `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md`, and `docs/qa/TETRIS_ACCEPTANCE.md` now mark
  D4 production work **in progress** before source edits. Existing dirty Hold
  removal, Marathon/Race rules, leaderboard work, Puzzle scaffolding, and layout
  corrections remain preserved.
- This resumes only the production D4 scope: complete typed deterministic Puzzle,
  Offset Drop ready/playing/pause/mode-switch layouts, and development visual-gate
  material. Full suite, build, formal evidence, commit, and push remain blocked until
  coordinator visual acceptance.

## 2026-07-14 — D4 development visual-gate material ready for coordinator review

- Implemented the Offset Drop D4 shell on the preserved dirty T2 work: one Pixi canvas
  now uses real board/Next DOM bounds; board-only scrim geometry; board-contained
  pause strip; external frozen mode switch; full three-mode names; and the five
  touch-zone rail. No T. mark, Hold/暂存 surface, visible Z/X help, DOM cells, card,
  modal, glass, jade grid, or fake telemetry was introduced.
- Added typed canonical Puzzle definitions `offset-01` through `offset-03` and
  deterministic public-command coverage for validation, no gravity, rotation success,
  two-piece success, budget failure, and restart/mode identity. Puzzle records remain
  presentation-local storage only.
- Development images and structured bounds are under
  `docs/screenshots/tetris/d4-dev/`; `geometry-summary.json` records 1:2 boards,
  zero reported non-nested intersections, 1 canvas, 0 DOM cells, no overflow, zero
  captured console errors, pause ratios 7.60% / 10.73% / 16.08%, and 58 px / 46 px
  mobile touch zones. The live Puzzle rotation replay hash is `e6936c36`.
- Validation so far is intentionally bounded: `npm.cmd run typecheck`; 44 selected
  core/input/render/leaderboard tests; and 3 runtime/QA tests. Full suite, build,
  formal evidence, commit, push, root changelog, and QA notification remain blocked
  pending coordinator visual approval.

## Recoverable report — TETRIS-T2-001

REPORT TETRIS-T2-001 READY
HEAD 0a28a1f4efad72296e46b0a91d859c45cc300edf; dirty T2/D4 production work, no candidate or commit.
evidence: `E:\Proj\reproduction-patricks-parabox\docs\screenshots\tetris\d4-dev\geometry-summary.json` plus the ten development PNGs in the same directory.
rules: typed three-Puzzle canonical state/replay; rotation replay hash `e6936c36`; targeted tests 47/47 and typecheck passed.
visual: 1:2 boards; board-contained pause 7.60%/10.73%/16.08%; 1 canvas, 0 DOM cells, no overflow, 0 captured console errors.
blocker: coordinator visual ACK is required; full suite/build/formal evidence/commit remain prohibited.
next: wait for `ACK TETRIS-T2-001` or a bounded correction request.
log: `E:\Proj\reproduction-patricks-parabox\docs\workstreams\tetris-t2\THREAD_LOG.md`.

## 2026-07-14 — D4 visual ACK; TETRIS-T2 finalization frozen

- Received `ACK TETRIS-T2-001`: coordinator manually reviewed all ten D4 development
  PNGs and `geometry-summary.json`. Offset Drop presentation is approved for the
  final-candidate gate.
- Presentation, copy, layout, color, and gameplay are now frozen. No product source
  correction is authorized or required; the already-passing typecheck and 47 targeted
  tests will be reused.
- Finalization sequence is exactly one full Vitest run, one build, one official
  Playwright evidence capture, rules/replay evidence audit, dirty-path audit, then a
  local unpushed candidate commit. `npm ci` is skipped unless dependency state blocks
  the mandated gates; root changelog and `docs/screenshots/temple/` remain out of
  scope.

## 2026-07-14 — TETRIS-T2-005 portable canonical evidence correction

- Coordinator superseded the checkout-filter semantics of TETRIS-T2-004. The sole
  authoritative checksum input is the raw Git blob stored in the candidate commit,
  streamed through `git show <candidate>:<path>`; neither working-tree bytes nor
  `core.autocrlf` filters participate.
- Recomputed all 18 entries against exact base
  `b4a51c19d372d72870c416181566855c8c9dcc19`. Two values were objectively stale
  under canonical blob semantics: `browser-evidence.json`
  `3a93695681620f296d03e8955a1464a00637f8ea309eb6ba609a9f4bc9408b94` →
  `bd1bed9445d058143b9aac6c8af5f6eaccf634addb2a5f5eaf1baa1b203b6c10`, and
  `rules-replay.json` `c3e9c3d111db1da80c33ca104ca43b66162d89e0a5544aedea8135f1d321dcbe` →
  `97fafadc2c29c6161aa56a3ac21e60b2d12545def7ab5f2fec1511b2016c9194`.
- The manifest now defines the portable blob procedure and records no filtered or
  working-tree hash. The other 16 entries are unchanged. No source, evidence JSON or
  PNG, package/config, QA log, Temple path, root changelog, test, build, or capture
  was touched or run.

## 2026-07-14 — TETRIS-T2-004 evidence-integrity correction

- Independent QA rejected `a7aca5fb060d2265036fcab72901c8abdd6860f5` solely because
  `SHA256SUMS.md` recorded the LF working-tree hash for `rules-replay.json`.
  `core.autocrlf=true` means a clean candidate checkout produces CRLF bytes whose
  SHA-256 is `c3e9c3d111db1da80c33ca104ca43b66162d89e0a5544aedea8135f1d321dcbe`.
- Recomputed every listed formal artifact through Git's checkout filter against the
  exact rejected candidate. Only the `rules-replay.json` line was objectively stale:
  `97fafadc2c29c6161aa56a3ac21e60b2d12545def7ab5f2fec1511b2016c9194` changed to
  `c3e9c3d111db1da80c33ca104ca43b66162d89e0a5544aedea8135f1d321dcbe`.
  The existing browser JSON `3a93695681620f296d03e8955a1464a00637f8ea309eb6ba609a9f4bc9408b94`
  already matched its CRLF checkout bytes; all PNG values remained unchanged.
- No product source, screenshot, evidence JSON, package/config, QA log, Temple path,
  or root changelog was changed. No install, test, build, typecheck, or capture ran.

## 2026-07-14 — TETRIS-T2-002 superseded; candidate prepared for independent QA

- Coordinator confirmed that the prior `TETRIS-T2-002 BLOCKED` report sampled the
  in-flight formal capture after a tool yield. It is superseded, not a product or
  evidence failure: the existing `browser-evidence.json` completed with
  `result: "passed"`, 16 captures, complete input proof, the Race/Marathon/Puzzle
  terminal captures, puzzle rotation hash `e6936c36`, and zero console/page errors.
- Read-only recomputation found every one of the 16 PNG SHA-256 values in
  `browser-evidence.json` matches its referenced file; no image was recaptured.
  `rules-replay.json` also proves public-command Marathon top-out, 20-line Race,
  all three Puzzle completions, Puzzle budget failure, and mode-separated records.
  `docs/qa/evidence/tetris-t2/SHA256SUMS.md` records both JSON and all PNG hashes.
- Manual review covered desktop/portrait/landscape mode-switch and paused PNGs plus
  Race-finished, Marathon-top-out, and Puzzle-rotation-finished. The mode-switch
  images have no Next/O residue; paused strips remain board-contained.
- Candidate contents intentionally exclude the pre-existing untracked
  `docs/screenshots/temple/` and the independent QA-owned
  `docs/workstreams/tetris-qa/THREAD_LOG.md`. Root `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md` is
  untouched. This workstream awaits a local, unpushed candidate commit and then
  independent QA; it does not claim release acceptance.
