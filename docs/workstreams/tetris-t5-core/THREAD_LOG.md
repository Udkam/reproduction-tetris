## 2026-07-16 — CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-CORE-001`
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`
- Writer intake HEAD: `9fc3cae6e07ebcfa8d82769f804c6d80c7d17485`
- Coordinator boundary commits received while the writer was active:
  - `bcf7ce1e33dcb0bf9a7f5d90fd6ee7362cb5d9be` authorized migration of stale
    Puzzle test/runtime QA assertions without opening production frontend/render paths.
  - `3f6a03ae652c75b5bfc74ae131dcd10e7aa7ced0` authorized the verifier-only
    T3 test correction after the full suite exposed its obsolete production coupling.
- Candidate SHA: this single writer commit; exact SHA is reported to the coordinator
  immediately after commit creation.

  replay, evidence, or log artifact changed)

### Delivered behavior and evidence

- Race has no successful line terminal. Clear resolution at 20 or any other line count
  remains `playing` and spawns the successor.
- Race speed tier is
  `floor(pieceCount / 5) + floor(lines / 4)`, clamped to the 17-entry safe gravity
  curve. Runtime QA now proves a deterministic live 24-line endurance milestone.
- Leaderboard schema v3 accepts only top-out rows. Race ordering is endurance-first:
  pieces, lines, score, then lower elapsed ticks.
- All six T5 Puzzle definitions use grounded solid-skyline boards with seven occupied
  rows, at least four distinct row shapes, 11/13/14/14/15/15 pieces, all seven piece
  types, and no identical-piece run longer than two.
- `puzzle-references.json` freezes six complete public-command routes. Every route uses
  the full budget, at least four effective rotations, at least five landing x values,
  at least one non-clearing lock, and multiple separated clear phases. It records
  initial/final hashes plus command/event digests.
- The same fixture freezes one legal one-column neighboring decision per level; all six
  consume the budget, retain canonical cells, and end `failed-budget` with stable hashes.
- Puzzle automatic gravity remains disabled. A soft-dropped grounded piece now advances
  the shared lock delay, enters the ordinary entry delay, and spawns the exact next
  authored piece. Hard-drop clear/no-clear routes are covered by the full references.
- `search-puzzles.mjs` is retained only as a bounded, deterministic clean-room authoring
  helper. It is not imported by production and is not a test gate; the authoritative
  proof is the real engine `dispatch` verifier in `puzzleCampaign.test.ts`.
- The frozen T3 verifier now checks only its own levels/replays shape, digest, command,
  queue, landing, and static cell-conservation facts. It no longer compares those
  historical artifacts with current T5 production definitions.
- Deprecated `RACE_TARGET_LINES` remains exported only so the still-blocked frontend
  slice compiles; no Core/runtime path reads it. The frontend slice must remove its old
  Race copy and then may remove this compatibility export.

### Commands actually run

- Focused T5 convergence:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/race.test.ts src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts src/leaderboard.test.ts src/puzzleProgress.test.ts src/game/render/presentation.test.ts`
  — PASS, 25 files / 123 tests.
- Historical verifier correction:
  `npm.cmd run test -- docs/workstreams/tetris-t3-rules/tests/campaign.verifier.test.ts`
  — final PASS, 3 files / 36 tests.
- First final typecheck exposed TS7022 at the two public-route movement loops. Both
  `beforeX` values were explicitly typed as `number`; no behavior changed.
- The next full suite exposed only the obsolete T3 verifier coupling: 36 files passed,
  1 historical verifier file failed 7 assertions. Work stopped until coordinator commit
  `3f6a03a` opened the verifier-only correction above.
- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- Final `npm.cmd run test` — PASS, 37 files / 234 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run build` — PASS; Vite transformed 739 modules and produced the
  production bundle.
- `git diff --check` — PASS before final gates; line-ending notices only.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns integration and push decisions.
- Next: independent read-only Core QA must inspect the exact reported candidate SHA,
  rerun only the proportionate Core/T5 checks it needs, and report ACCEPT or REJECT to
  the coordinator before the frontend slice begins.

## 2026-07-16 — QA FIX PAUSED FOR CONTRACT UPDATE

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-CORE-QA-FIX-001`
- Base SHA: `3bf170ec252cc971b1f65d73b4649fabb2500dbb`
- Independent QA result: **REJECT**. The sole finding was the DEV
  `RuntimeQaSurface.replayScenario` hook assigning an offline replay terminal state
  directly into the mounted live runtime, bypassing visible UI and canonical play.
- Exact changed paths so far:
  - `src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.ts`
  - `src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts`
  - `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/THREAD_LOG.md`
- Fix: removed the replay imports, QA-surface type member, live callback, and all direct
  replay-state assignment. The pure functions in `qaScenario.ts` remain isolated unit
  helpers and are not exposed on `window`.
- Proof: the mounted QA surface has no `replayScenario`, `setState`, or `replaceState`;
  mutating the structured clone returned by `getState()` cannot alter runtime state.
- Targeted command:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts` — PASS, 3 files / 10 tests.
- Final typecheck/full test/build: intentionally not run. The coordinator paused the
  candidate after the user superseded the finite-queue Puzzle contract with normal-play
  seeded seven-bag, automatic-gravity, no-budget Puzzle rules.
- Commit/push: not performed.
- Blocker: `docs/DESIGN.md` and `docs/CURRENT_TASK.md` must be updated before any new Puzzle rule
  implementation is authorized.
- Next: retain this minimal QA fix in the dirty worktree and wait for the coordinator's
  revised bounded Puzzle slice.

## 2026-07-16 — NORMAL-PLAY PUZZLE CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-PUZZLE-NORMALPLAY-002`
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`
- Base SHA: `79f60dd7a5c9ee16cb8a4c8fb8e958e2208e906e`
- Preserved intake delta: the three-path `TETRIS-T5-CORE-QA-FIX-001` removal of the
  mounted `replayScenario` state-injection path above.
- Candidate SHA: this single writer commit; exact SHA is reported immediately after
  commit creation.

### Exact changed paths

No frontend/render production path, `puzzleProgress.ts`, coordinator document,
changelog, T3/T4 evidence, or QA archive was edited.

### Delivered behavior and production evidence

- Puzzle now changes only the stable starting board, level-owned seed, and
  canonical-board-empty success condition. It shares Marathon gravity, score, SRS,
  lock delay, entry delay, clear delay, soft/hard drop, and the continuously
  replenishing deterministic seven-bag.
- The engine does not read an authored Puzzle queue, piece budget, remaining count,
  or numeric difficulty. It does not emit `failed-budget`; an unsolved game continues
  until success, restart/exit, or ordinary `block-out`/`lock-out`, both mapped to
  `failed-top-out` for the Puzzle result surface.
- Each known Puzzle ID is bound to one exact stable nonzero seed. The first 84 pieces
  for every seed are frozen and verified as twelve complete consecutive seven-bags.
- The six original boards occupy 10/10/10/8/8/10 rows. Every board has 8–10 unique row
  shapes, four row densities (6/7/8/9 occupied cells), 7–8 covered-hole columns, and
  10–15 buried cavities. No board is a repeated floor template or single I-well.
- `puzzle-references.json` freezes two same-seed routes per level. Locked-piece counts
  are 35/35, 35/35, 30/30, 29/29, 34/34, and 30/30. The second routes differ at
  29/24/4/4/15/5 semantic lock indices and every pair has an intermediate canonical
  board-hash divergence.
- All twelve routes use all seven types, 9–11 landing x values, 19–30 effective
  rotations, 14–21 non-clearing locks, and 13–19 separated clear phases. They finish
  only when the canonical 40 × 10 board is empty.
- The authoritative verifier drives production `createInitialState` and public
  `dispatch` only. It verifies spawn type, every effective rotation, every horizontal
  movement path, hard-drop landing Y, clear count, delayed entry/clear resolution,
  terminal state, restart hash, route diversity, and frozen initial/final,
  command/event, and board-trace digests. The value 70 exists only as its safety guard.
- `GameRuntime.setReducedMotion(boolean)` forwards only the renderer option and does
  not rebuild or replace canonical state. Mounted DEV QA exposes a structured-clone
  read view and no replay, `setState`, or `replaceState` hook.

### Bounded authoring search evidence

- `search-puzzles.mjs` is an authoring helper only; its geometry proposals were not
  accepted until the TypeScript public-dispatch verifier passed.
- The initial one-hole-per-row prototype found 6/6 pairs quickly but was discarded
  because it violated the frozen no-repeated-floor-template rule.
- A fully random 1–4-hole prototype produced no Level 1 route within 120 seconds and
  was also discarded. The final generator uses staggered 1–5-cell cavity profiles,
  at least three row densities, and multiple covered holes.
- Successful bounded searches were:
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 0 18 4000 120000`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 1 12 4000 180000 7`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 2 16 4000 180000 0`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 3 16 4000 180000 0`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 4 20 4000 210000 0`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 5 20 4000 240000 6`
- Bounded failure evidence was retained instead of weakening thresholds: early Level 2
  candidates found 32- and 24-lock first routes but no second route in 150 seconds;
  early Level 6 candidates found a 29-lock first route but no second route in 210
  seconds. Later candidate indices produced the accepted pairs.

### Commands actually run

- `node --check docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs` — PASS after the
  final helper change.
- Focused convergence command covering Core definitions/flow/campaign, runtime QA,
  runtime boundary, progress fixture, and presentation Next:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts src/puzzleProgress.test.ts src/game/render/presentation.test.ts`
  — PASS, 19 files / 92 tests.
- Final focused stable-seed validation:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts` — PASS, 3 files / 16 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- Final `npm.cmd run test` — PASS, 37 files / 236 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run build` — PASS; Vite transformed 738 modules and produced the
  production bundle.

### Deliberate compatibility debt for the frontend slice

- `puzzlePieceBudget` remains a deprecated state-field bridge and is always `null`.
- `puzzleQueue`/`puzzleQueueIndex` remain a deprecated generated-Next bridge: they
  mirror the shared queue at index zero and have no generation or terminal authority.
- `failed-budget`, `failed-invalid-spawn`, and the two matching event-reason literals
  remain type-only compatibility values; production Puzzle engine paths never emit them.
- `nextUnlockedLevelId` remains navigation/progress compatibility only and never
  controls Core availability. The frontend slice owns the all-levels-enabled UI and
  completion-only persistence migration.
- `PUZZLE_DEFINITIONS` exposes a deprecated type-only `difficulty` facade so the
  forbidden old `puzzleProgress.ts` compiles; runtime definition objects contain no
  numeric difficulty. Frontend must remove that read, then the facade can be deleted.
- `RACE_TARGET_LINES` remains the already documented frontend compile bridge; no
  Core/runtime rule reads it.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Commit: one candidate commit is created after final diff/path checks.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns integration and push decisions.
- Next: independent read-only Core QA verifies the exact candidate SHA before the
  coordinator authorizes frontend integration.

## 2026-07-17 — FIFTEEN-LEVEL CAMPAIGN CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-PUZZLE-CAMPAIGN-15-006`
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`
- Base SHA: `ef2d7472eeb2cf461c5408101f045207605334ec`
- Scope: exactly fifteen all-enabled Puzzle definitions, deterministic multi-color
  starting boards, nine new original masks/seeds, and thirty same-seed successful
  public-command routes. No engine/random/runtime/frontend rule path was opened.
- Candidate SHA: this single writer commit; the exact SHA is reported to the
  coordinator immediately after creation.

### Exact changed paths

- `src/game/core/types.ts`
- `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`
- `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`
- `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`
- `src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts`
- `src/puzzleProgress.test.ts`
- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs`
- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/puzzle-references.json`
- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/build-puzzle-references.test.ts` (the one authorized
  new reference-builder helper)
- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/THREAD_LOG.md`

### Delivered implementation and evidence

- Production exports exactly fifteen definitions. The first six retain their exact
  IDs, seeds, bottom alignment, normalized occupancy masks, and both placement streams.
  A base/current JSON comparison reported `allCompatible: true` for all four facts on
  every legacy level.
- A separate randomizer seeded with `level.seed ^ 0xa57e31d9` colors occupied cells
  without sharing or mutating gameplay randomizer state. Every board uses all seven
  piece types in the generated fixture; the gameplay active/preview stream still
  matches direct draws from the unmodified level seed for every definition.
- Geometry validation normalizes colors to occupancy before row-shape checks. All
  fifteen boards have at least six occupancy shapes, four density classes, five
  covered-cavity columns, and eight buried holes. The nine new boards each have ten
  occupied rows, ten shapes, four density classes, 5-9 covered columns, and 11-14
  buried holes; all fifteen normalized masks are unique.
- All fifteen seeds freeze the first 84 pieces as twelve complete seven-bags and prove
  another complete bag after that validation horizon.
- `puzzle-references.json` is 15 levels / 30 routes. New-route metrics are 30-35 locks,
  24-38 effective rotations, 10-11 landing x values, 14-20 non-clearing setup locks,
  and 15-19 clear phases. Paired semantic differences are 3-27 and every pair diverges
  at a real common-index intermediate canonical board hash.
- The generated JSON is 217,515 UTF-8 bytes. Re-running the builder with the same nine
  ignored authoring results produced the identical SHA-256
  `F1A05DB8CA31B6833FCF09F096A5C726E29D5B95274897A2A7E0259A5ED7696C`.
- Builder input merges by level ID, rejects seed or placement conflicts, initializes
  production `createInitialState(seed, "puzzle", id)`, and uses public `dispatch` only.
  It never constructs, replaces, or mutates canonical state.

### Bounded clean-room search record

- `search-puzzles.mjs` now accepts `--seed <uint32>` and an optional 9-12 row height,
  rejects topology below 6 shapes / 4 densities / 5 covered columns / 8 buried holes,
  and enforces the 28-35-lock route floor without changing the 70-lock verifier guard.
- At most two hidden Node processes ran concurrently. Every process wrote unique
  ignored `.local/tetris-t5-search/seed-*.{json,log}` output; no product or formal
  evidence path received search scratch data.
- Accepted seeds/candidates were `91e2b43d/5`, `c37a58e1/5`, `a5c91367/1`,
  `d1596af5/1`, `73bc20e9/2`, `b47d8e23/1`, `5c29f6a1/2`, `f2a7634b/0`, and
  `8ea45d17/1`. The first four used the default 9-12 cycle with 20 candidates,
  beam 4000, and 240 seconds; later searches used explicit height 10, with the final
  two bounded to 6 candidates / 150 seconds.
- Bounded misses `6d4a9f17`, `4f86d2b9`, `2be74d83`, `e8451c2f`, and `38af71c5`
  were discarded rather than weakening a gate. Hedge seed `17dce985` also succeeded
  but remained ignored: `8ea45d17` was selected for stronger covered/buried topology
  and greater mean 200-cell Hamming distance from the preceding eight new masks.

### Commands and results before final gates

- `node --check docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs` — PASS after the
  final helper change.
- Explicit-seed smoke with 1 candidate / beam 120 / 1 second — bounded miss as
  expected; CLI and JSON output were valid.
- Mid-authoring production builder verification — PASS, current 11 levels / 22 routes,
  proving the search mirror had not produced false-positive placements.
- Full reference builder with nine selected ignored results — PASS, 1 test; all 15
  levels / 30 routes executed before JSON replacement.
- Focused convergence:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts src/puzzleProgress.test.ts docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/build-puzzle-references.test.ts`
  — PASS, 75 tests; the environment-gated builder was the one intentional skip.
- Idempotent full builder rerun — PASS, 1 test; JSON SHA-256 unchanged.
- `git diff --check` — PASS during pre-final audit; line-ending notices only.

### Final gate status and handoff

- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- Final `npm.cmd run test` — PASS, 38 files / 248 tests; the environment-gated
  reference writer was the one intentional skipped file/test.
- Final `npm.cmd run build` — PASS; Vite transformed 739 modules and produced the
  production bundle.
- Final explicit `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts` — PASS,
  3 files / 47 tests, including the exact 15-level / 30-route production verifier.
- Blocker: none.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns QA integration and push decisions.
- Next: create one candidate commit and hand the exact SHA to independent read-only
  Core QA before any frontend integration or push decision.

## 2026-07-17 — LEGAL AUTHORED ENDGAMES CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-PUZZLE-AUTHORED-ENDGAMES-009`
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`
- Writer base SHA: `50be21d70abab887051b85d412a102f0b77eb9d2`
- Core checkpoint A: `ee0d996f7309ead46654fc76bc2855f4c2ea73b6`
  (`feat(puzzle): add legal authored endgame search`)
- Core checkpoint B: `2d282b6796072c6fcd0d031c474f640c987c77a1`
  (`feat(puzzle): author fifteen legal endgame setups`)
- Integrated product/source SHA after the separately owned Slice J-R fixture migration:
  `26ef004dc4ab11de8caeee6605bbe21044c5d950`.
- Final HEAD also contains runtime's log-only checkpoint `aab0dc9`; it changes no
  product, Core, reference, or verifier path.

### Exact Core paths

- Checkpoint A changes only
  `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs`.
- Checkpoint B changes only:
  - `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`;
  - `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`;
  - `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`;
  - `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/build-puzzle-references.test.ts`;
  - `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/puzzle-references.json`.
- This final documentation checkpoint changes only
  `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/THREAD_LOG.md`.

### Delivered authored-endgame contract

- Removed `BOARD_COLOR_SALT`, `colorizeBoardRows`, random hole excavation, and every
  per-cell color draw from production Puzzle definition authority.
- Each level now owns a frozen separate setup seed and 16–22 explicit
  `{ type, rotation, x }` placements. Production reconstructs the board through the
  ordinary board/piece legality functions: each setup type matches the next setup-bag
  draw, landing `y` is derived by hard drop, and every setup lock is zero-clear with no
  top-out or hidden occupancy.
- The fifteen setup counts are
  `20, 20, 19, 20, 20, 21, 20, 22, 20, 21, 21, 19, 16, 22, 20`.
  Every final board uses all seven materials; each same-material connected component
  is exactly one canonical four-cell tetromino and same-material source pieces never
  share an orthogonal edge.
- The thirty public-dispatch completion routes have lock counts
  `35/35, 35/35, 41/36, 35/35, 35/35, 39/39, 30/40, 38/38, 35/35,
  34/34, 39/39, 36/36, 39/39, 33/38, 35/35`.
  All retain automatic gravity and an indefinitely replenishing gameplay seven-bag.
- Paired first-divergence locks are
  `1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2`; paired canonical board-hash
  divergence counts are
  `34, 33, 35, 32, 30, 38, 27, 35, 33, 32, 38, 35, 37, 33, 33`.
  Thus route diversity is real state divergence, not only a different command spelling.
- Search and reference output keep `landingY` only as diagnostic evidence. Production
  setup and route placements contain only the authored type/rotation/x contract.

### Reference identity and L7/L13 audit

- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/puzzle-references.json` is 263,980 bytes, contains
  15 levels / 30 routes, has 11,723 LF bytes and zero CRLF pairs, and hashes to SHA-256
  `4c8f9fac3451b2e888c5560126b75c5cd949c7e1a947f04274698e93c0171bec`.
- Final pairwise occupancy Hamming minimum is 24 (L1/L15), above the required 20.
- A prior L7/L13 candidate at direct Hamming 20 was discarded rather than weakening
  the gate. The final pair is direct Hamming 40, horizontal-mirror Hamming 38,
  vertical-mirror Hamming 144, and 180-degree Hamming 144.
- L7 is a left-high terrace with multilayer central cavities: 20 setup locks and
  30/40 completion locks. L13 is a right-side I cap with split vertical wells:
  16 setup locks and 39/39 completion locks. Their distinct topology survives direct
  and mirrored comparisons.

### Search, generation, and targeted evidence

- Search used at most two Node processes concurrently and wrote only ignored results
  below `.local/tetris-t5-endgames/`. Failed candidates were discarded; no setup,
  topology, route-length, route-diversity, or pairwise-distance threshold was lowered.
- Initial bounded probe:
  `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs --seed 1975562497 --setup-seed 2712847316 1 300 10000 0 20`
  — PASS in 6,768 ms; 20 setup locks, 10 occupied rows, 9 row shapes, 4 density
  classes, 9 covered columns, 11 buried holes, and two 35/40-lock routes.
- The final verifier inputs were `.local/tetris-t5-endgames/level-01.json` through
  `level-15.json`, with the intentionally replaced L13 input
  `.local/tetris-t5-endgames/level-13-alt3.json`.
- Environment-gated setup smoke with one result — PASS, 1 test / 1 skipped.
- Full write-enabled builder with all fifteen final results — PASS, 1 test / 1 skipped;
  it produced the signed reference identity above.
- Targeted production convergence — PASS, 7 files / 65 tests; separate Puzzle-flow
  convergence — PASS, 1 file / 2 tests.

### Failed full-suite attempt and bounded Slice J-R resolution

- The first post-Core-source `npm.cmd run test` attempt had one failure after
  38 passed files / 1 skipped file and 251 passed tests / 2 skipped tests:
  `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts` reported
  `Puzzle challenge QA route expected Z, received none`.
- Cause: `PUZZLE_CHALLENGE_QA_ROUTE` still contained the rejected pre-Slice-J route;
  the failure did not invalidate the Core setup or route references. Core stopped
  without touching runtime.
- The separately bounded Slice J-R writer replaced only that frozen route in
  `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.ts` and created source checkpoint
  `26ef004dc4ab11de8caeee6605bbe21044c5d950`. Its focused runtime suite passed before
  this Core owner resumed the final sequence.

### One green final sequence on source SHA `26ef004`

- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- `npm.cmd run test` — PASS, 39 files / 1 skipped file and 252 tests / 2 skipped
  tests. The jsdom `HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()` notice was non-failing test-environment
  output.
- `npm.cmd run build` — PASS; Vite transformed 739 modules and emitted the production
  bundle.
- The complete explicit verifier set:
  - set `VERIFY_PUZZLE_AUTHORING=1` and `VERIFY_PUZZLE_SETUP=1`;
  - set `PUZZLE_AUTHORING_RESULTS` to the exact fifteen paths described above;
  - run
    `npm.cmd run test -- docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/build-puzzle-references.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`.
  Result: PASS, 4 files / 49 tests, covering all 15 setup replays and all 30 signed
  completion routes without rewriting the reference.
- `git diff --check` — PASS before this log edit.
- Blocker: none.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns independent QA integration and push.
- Next: independent read-only Core/runtime QA reviews the exact contiguous Slice J +
  J-R candidate range before Slice K or push.

## 2026-07-18 — SHORTER GROUNDED LOCK WINDOW CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-SHORT-LOCK-WINDOW-014`.
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`.
- Contract/intake base SHA: `8a2c1cb4d4e08d64a3149bbe377940b7d55226b4`.
- Shared-worktree source parent: `1db3417fd8ae3c9b5cddf482e28eb8ce67b783e0`;
  this intervening coordinator-only countdown contract checkpoint did not overlap the
  K-R4 source or log paths.
- Source checkpoint: `f0ec47c878aa52fd10cd2e5776ed964c9bff013d`
  (`fix(core): shorten grounded lock window`).

### Exact source paths

- `src/game/core/constants.ts`.
- `src/game/core/core.test.ts`.

### Delivered timing regression

- `LOCK_DELAY_TICKS` changes only from 30 to exactly 18 fixed ticks. No other Core
  constant changed; `MAX_LOCK_RESETS`, entry/clear delays, gravity, hard drop,
  scoring, hashes, and shared mode semantics remain untouched.
- The direct Classic regression fixes the duration to literal tick 17 / tick 18
  behavior: after 17 grounded ticks the O piece is still active, the board is empty,
  and a legal horizontal move succeeds while preserving the existing lock-reset
  behavior. An independent transition from the same tick-17 state locks on tick 18,
  increments `pieceCount`, writes exactly four cells, and emits `piece-locked`.
- Existing focused lockdown and Puzzle-flow tests continued to exercise the shared
  constant and unchanged reset cap.

### Commands and results

- `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/core.test.ts src/game/core/rules.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts`
  — PASS, 7 files / 62 tests.
- `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- `git diff --check -- src/game/core/constants.ts src/game/core/core.test.ts` — PASS;
  Git emitted only its existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy notices.
- Exact source staging and cached checks — PASS; the cached list contained only the
  two source paths above and `git diff --cached --check` reported no error.
- Full suite, build, and browser were intentionally not run under the K-R4 boundary.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns integration and push.
- Next: independent read-only Core QA reviews exact source
  `f0ec47c878aa52fd10cd2e5776ed964c9bff013d`, then the coordinator runs the combined
  post-K-R4/K-R5/K-R6 final gates required by the active contract.

## 2026-07-18 — T6 DISTINCT MODES CORE + BEDROCK CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T6-THREE-DISTINCT-MODES-017`.
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`.
- Accepted T5 base: `c0340b1d3e30007473da6a7a4ec0fed72a22df38`.
- Final pre-source contract tip: `d1705ea` (including the type-safe renderer bridge
  and Puzzle reference-scoring compatibility discovered during focused verification).
- Source checkpoint: `34184cb` (`feat(survival): raise permanent bedrock every five lines`).

### Exact source and direct-test paths

- `src/game/core/constants.ts`.
- `src/game/core/board.ts`.
- `src/game/core/engine.ts`.
- `src/game/core/types.ts`.
- `src/game/core/race.test.ts`.
- `src/game/core/rules.test.ts`.
- `src/game/render/theme.ts`.
- `src/game/render/theme.test.ts`.
- `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`.

### Delivered rule identities

- Classic now uses fixed 48-tick gravity and no visible or functional level
  progression. Consecutive clearing pieces build `combo` 1, 2, ... and add
  `50 × (combo - 1)` after the fixed base clear score; a non-clearing lock resets it.
- Internal mode `race` is now Survival: fixed 48-tick gravity, no speed curve, no
  combo bonus, and one permanent bedrock row after every five cumulative cleared
  lines. Clearing/scoring resolves before the board is pushed upward.
- `BEDROCK_CELL` is a real `BoardCell` union member, blocks placement, is excluded
  from full-row detection and clearing, and renders through its own coordinated
  mineral material rather than an unsafe `PieceType` cast.
- A catch-up rise fails closed with `bedrock-overflow` before next spawn when it would
  discard an occupied canonical top row. Restart resets bedrock height and replay/hash
  includes Survival bedrock while excluding irrelevant combo state.
- Puzzle keeps fixed 48-tick gravity and no combo. Its invisible historical
  score/event serialization is retained so all thirty accepted reference event
  digests and final hashes remain unchanged; no reference artifact was edited.

### Commands and results

- First focused run exposed two bounded issues: the initial bedrock lower fill had
  2.90:1 well contrast, and removing Puzzle's invisible score serialization changed
  all fifteen reference pairs' event/final hashes. The material was corrected above
  3:1 and the contract/source preserved the accepted Puzzle evidence compatibility.
- Final `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/rules.test.ts src/game/core/race.test.ts
  src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts src/game/render/theme.test.ts` — PASS, 10 files
  / 99 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- `git diff --check` and exact cached-path inspection — PASS; Git emitted only the
  existing LF-to-CRLF working-copy notices.
- Full suite, build, browser capture, formal evidence, changelog, and push were not
  run under this source boundary.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Dirty paths after source commit: only this Core log while being recorded.
- Push: not performed.
- Next: bind player-facing `生存`, bedrock height, Classic `连消`, and Survival QA in
  the authorized frontend/runtime slice, then route the combined source to
  independent read-only Core and browser QA.

## 2026-07-18 — T7 TIMED SURVIVAL PRESSURE CORE CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T7-TIMED-SURVIVAL-MOTION-019`.
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`.
- Clean contract/base SHA: `2221b3e265b5ba16a2f9e7df22977a2d86385653`.
- Source checkpoint: `ff90d61b52acf6e0438a4a7233832bae1a26778a`
  (`feat(survival): add timed bedrock pressure`).

### Exact source and direct-test paths

- `src/game/core/constants.ts`.
- `src/game/core/types.ts`.
- `src/game/core/board.ts`.
- `src/game/core/engine.ts`.
- `src/game/core/race.test.ts`.
- `src/game/core/rules.test.ts`.

### Delivered deterministic rules

- Classic and Survival now share the exact ten-line gravity table
  `48, 43, 38, 33, 28, 23, 18, 13, 10, 8, 6, 5, 4, 3`, capped at three ticks;
  Puzzle remains fixed at 48 ticks.
- Survival pressure starts at 40 seconds and uses
  `max(10, 40 - 2 × floor(lines / 5))`. `survivalPressureTicks` advances only while
  canonical status is `playing`; at the exact interval it freezes with
  `survivalRisePending=true` until a safe resolution.
- A pending row resolves after a lock/clear and before the next spawn. A normal clear
  resolves first; crossing a five-line threshold then lowers exactly one bottom
  bedrock row if present and always resets the timer under the shorter interval.
  `bedrock-raised` and the new `bedrock-lowered` events preserve this ordering.
- A timed rise shifts the board up, appends one bedrock row, and top-outs with
  `bedrock-overflow` when the canonical top was occupied. Pause freezes pressure;
  restart clears the timer, pending flag, height, and board bedrock.
- Survival hashes include pressure ticks and pending state. Classic and Puzzle hashes
  exclude these irrelevant fields; all thirty Puzzle reference routes, hashes, and
  event digests remain unchanged.

### Commands and results

- Development `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/race.test.ts src/game/core/rules.test.ts
  src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts` — PASS, 9 files / 98 tests.
- Development `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- Final `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core` — PASS, 16 files / 151 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- `git diff --check`, exact cached-path inspection, and
  `git diff --cached --check` — PASS; Git emitted only the existing LF-to-CRLF
  working-copy notices.
- Full suite, build, browser capture, coordinator evidence, and push were intentionally
  not run under this Core writer boundary.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns combined verification, QA, integration, and
  push.
- Next: the authorized frontend/runtime writer binds the new pressure fields and
  events, then independent read-only Core QA reviews source `ff90d61` in the combined
  T7 candidate.

## 2026-07-19 — T9 five-layer Survival descent candidate

- Task: `TETRIS-T9-SURVIVAL-DESCENT-020`; base `502f978` on `main`; source
  checkpoint `0ebb0cb feat(survival): add five-layer descent`.
- Exact paths: `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`,
  `src/game/core/race.test.ts`, `src/game/core/rules.test.ts`,
  `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.ts`, and `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts`.
- Implemented five initial/restart bedrock rows, the 15→8-second three-line pressure
  formula, one removed row for each crossed three-line boundary, and the matching
  three-line Survival gravity tier. Puzzle remains fixed at 48 ticks; Classic stays
  on ten-line tiers.
- Commands run: focused `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/race.test.ts
  src/game/core/rules.test.ts src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts src/App.test.ts`
  (10 files / 65 tests PASS); final coordinator typecheck, full suite, and build are
  recorded in the T9 candidate log. Blocker: independent Core QA. Next: review
  `502f978..7910e91`; no push by this writer.

## 2026-07-19 — T10 Puzzle anchors and post-lock expiry candidate

- Task: `TETRIS-T10-PUZZLE-ANCHORS-023`; base `15e6412` on `main`.
- Exact paths: `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `src/game/core/types.ts`,
  `src/game/core/board.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`, `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`,
  `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`, `src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts`, and
  `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`.
- Added permanent Puzzle-only `A` anchors, retained-anchor row resolution,
  removable-only victory, seeded volatile locks with a 600-tick timer, expiry events,
  metadata remapping across clears, and whole-component falling after expiry.
  Replaced levels 13–15 with deterministic low-pressure vertical-I anchor trials;
  the first twelve legacy route hashes remain frozen and pass unchanged.
- Commands: focused core suite (7 files / 66 tests) PASS; final typecheck PASS; full
  suite (40 files / 270 passed / 2 skipped) PASS; production build (741 modules) PASS.
  Browser review is recorded in the coordinator progress log.
- Blocker: independent Core and visual/browser QA. Next: review this exact source
  checkpoint with the unpushed T9 range; do not push.

## 2026-07-19 — T10 sparse archive overlay correction candidate

- Task: `TETRIS-T10-PUZZLE-ANCHORS-023` correction; base `3dfedca` on `main`.
- Exact paths: `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`,
  `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`, `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`,
  `src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts`, and `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`.
- Restored the original data for levels 13–15 and overlaid deterministic anchors
  only: one on levels 3/6/9/12 and two on levels 13/14/15. All seven anchored
  entries use removable-only victory and may draw volatile inputs. The timer is
  now exactly 300 playing ticks (5 seconds); original empty-board data, legal
  setup history, stable seed, and seven-bag checks remain frozen.
- Commands: focused core campaign/flow/definition suite PASS (7 files / 66
  tests); focused combined regression suite and typecheck recorded by coordinator.
  Blocker: independent Core QA. Next: review the exact committed correction; no push.

## 2026-07-19 — T10 expiry-origin correction candidate

- Task: `TETRIS-T10-PUZZLE-ANCHORS-023` correction; base `3dfedca` on `main`.
- Exact path: `src/game/core/engine.ts`, with direct regression coverage in
  `src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts`.
- Replaced the global post-expiry gravity scan. Only a complete component directly
  above a cell opened by the expired volatile piece can begin falling; it then
  descends as a whole to normal rest. An unrelated floating J component is now
  explicitly proven not to move.
- Source checkpoint: `ea04f6c fix(puzzle): constrain volatile expiry fallout`.
  Commands: focused Puzzle flow / runtime / App tests PASS (5 files / 33 tests);
  final typecheck, full suite, and build are recorded in the coordinator log.
  Blocker: independent Core QA. Next: review the committed correction with the
  archive overlay work; no push.

## TETRIS-T11-PUZZLE-SURVIVAL-031 — candidate report

- Task: target-clear Puzzle budget and Survival baseline; base `526f394` on `main`.
  Exact core paths: `src/game/core/types.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`,
  `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`, Puzzle/core/replay QA tests, and runtime seed handling.
- Original authored cells are canonical targets that move through normal clears and
  bounded volatile settlement. Completion clears every target on or before the
  per-level solver budget plus ten locks; anchors remain deterministic but only occupy
  authored-empty visible rows outside the target set. Puzzle retains its fixed level
  queue while Classic and Survival request a fresh runtime seed for every run/restart.
- Survival now starts with ten bedrock rows, rises on its existing 15→8 second
  pressure, removes one row per three cleared lines, and keeps a fixed 40-tick gravity.
- Source checkpoints: `1c91bbf feat(puzzle): track original targets within budget`,
  `f0dc8dd feat(survival): open with fixed ten-row pressure`, and
  `e754d09 feat(runtime): refresh ordinary run seeds`.
- Commands: focused core/replay coverage, final typecheck, full suite, and production
  build PASS; final suite is 40 files / 288 tests passed with 1 file / 2 tests skipped.
  Browser evidence confirms canonical Puzzle target/budget state and Survival opening.
- Blocker: independent Core QA. Next: read the candidate range and the coordinator's
  visual/browser evidence; recovery publication is not acceptance.

## 2026-07-19 — T12 pinned-anchor and curriculum candidate

- Task: `TETRIS-T12-PUZZLE-CURRICULUM-033`; base `a76eea2` recovery baseline on
  `main`; source `95c7da7 feat(t12): deliver coupled Puzzle campaign migration`.
- Exact core paths: `src/game/core/board.ts`, `src/game/core/board.test.ts`,
  `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `src/game/core/engine.ts`,
  `src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts`, `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`,
  `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`, `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`, and
  `src/game/core/types.ts`.
- `A` anchors now remain at their authored coordinates through a clear below them and
  through a full anchor row. Ordinary cells and original targets only settle inside
  their own anchor-delimited vertical segment; all volatile/expiry state, events, and
  support-settlement code are removed. The campaign has 20 deterministic legal setup
  histories, with only the first three available through persistence and five new
  accepted solver budgets of 40/43/43/44/52 locks.
- Commands: targeted core, campaign, persistence, App, audio, and theme matrix PASS
  (14 files / 109 tests); final typecheck PASS; full suite PASS (41 files / 292 tests,
  1 file / 2 tests skipped); production build PASS (741 modules). Browser review is
  in the coordinator progress record.
- Blocker: independent Core and visual/browser QA. Next: review the contiguous
  `a76eea2..95c7da7` candidate range; do not mark accepted or publish as QA-complete.

## 2026-07-19 — T12.1 active-piece visible-boundary candidate

- Task: `TETRIS-T12-RENDER-BOUNDARY-035`; base `95c7da7` with T12.1 contract
  `91e9c0f`; source `7ae1190 fix(t12): contain active piece presentation`.
- Exact paths: `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`,
  `src/game/render/presentation.ts`, and
  `src/game/render/presentation.test.ts`.
- Renderer-only repair: Core retains `y:19` buffered spawn and every deterministic
  replay coordinate. The visible active group is filtered to rows 0–19, its requested
  interpolation is clamped to both vertical well edges, and its scale pulse is neutral
  whenever it touches or is clamped at an edge. Next/ghost contracts remain separate.
- Commands: targeted App/presentation PASS (27 tests); final typecheck PASS; full suite
  PASS (41 files / 293 tests, 1 file / 2 tests skipped); production build PASS
  (741 modules). Browser evidence freezes a real Survival `J@3,20` whose presentation
  still reports `offsetY:-0.457…`; visual output stays within the top board frame with
  zero console errors.
- Blocker: independent renderer and visual/browser QA. Next: review `7ae1190` against
  the T12.1 contract; do not call the candidate accepted or publish it as QA-complete.
