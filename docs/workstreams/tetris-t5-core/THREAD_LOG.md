## 2026-07-16 — CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-CORE-001`
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`
- Writer intake HEAD: `9fc3cae6e07ebcfa8d82769f804c6d80c7d17485`
- Coordinator boundary commits received while the writer was active:
  - `bcf7ce1e33dcb0bf9a7f5d90fd6ee7362cb5d9be` authorized migration of stale
    Puzzle test/runtime QA assertions without opening production frontend/render paths.
  - `3f6a03ae652c75b5bfc74ae131dcd10e7aa7ced0` authorized the verifier-only
    T3 test correction after the full suite exposed its obsolete production coupling.
- Candidate SHA: this single writer commit; exact SHA is reported to the coordinator
  immediately after commit creation.

  replay, evidence, or log artifact changed)

### Delivered behavior and evidence

- Race has no successful line terminal. Clear resolution at 20 or any other line count
  remains `playing` and spawns the successor.
- Race speed tier is
  `floor(pieceCount / 5) + floor(lines / 4)`, clamped to the 17-entry safe gravity
  curve. Runtime QA now proves a deterministic live 24-line endurance milestone.
- Leaderboard schema v3 accepts only top-out rows. Race ordering is endurance-first:
  pieces, lines, score, then lower elapsed ticks.
- All six T5 Puzzle definitions use grounded solid-skyline boards with seven occupied
  rows, at least four distinct row shapes, 11/13/14/14/15/15 pieces, all seven piece
  types, and no identical-piece run longer than two.
- `puzzle-references.json` freezes six complete public-command routes. Every route uses
  the full budget, at least four effective rotations, at least five landing x values,
  at least one non-clearing lock, and multiple separated clear phases. It records
  initial/final hashes plus command/event digests.
- The same fixture freezes one legal one-column neighboring decision per level; all six
  consume the budget, retain canonical cells, and end `failed-budget` with stable hashes.
- Puzzle automatic gravity remains disabled. A soft-dropped grounded piece now advances
  the shared lock delay, enters the ordinary entry delay, and spawns the exact next
  authored piece. Hard-drop clear/no-clear routes are covered by the full references.
- `search-puzzles.mjs` is retained only as a bounded, deterministic clean-room authoring
  helper. It is not imported by production and is not a test gate; the authoritative
  proof is the real engine `dispatch` verifier in `puzzleCampaign.test.ts`.
- The frozen T3 verifier now checks only its own levels/replays shape, digest, command,
  queue, landing, and static cell-conservation facts. It no longer compares those
  historical artifacts with current T5 production definitions.
- Deprecated `RACE_TARGET_LINES` remains exported only so the still-blocked frontend
  slice compiles; no Core/runtime path reads it. The frontend slice must remove its old
  Race copy and then may remove this compatibility export.

### Commands actually run

- Focused T5 convergence:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/race.test.ts src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts src/leaderboard.test.ts src/puzzleProgress.test.ts src/game/render/presentation.test.ts`
  — PASS, 25 files / 123 tests.
- Historical verifier correction:
  `npm.cmd run test -- docs/workstreams/tetris-t3-rules/tests/campaign.verifier.test.ts`
  — final PASS, 3 files / 36 tests.
- First final typecheck exposed TS7022 at the two public-route movement loops. Both
  `beforeX` values were explicitly typed as `number`; no behavior changed.
- The next full suite exposed only the obsolete T3 verifier coupling: 36 files passed,
  1 historical verifier file failed 7 assertions. Work stopped until coordinator commit
  `3f6a03a` opened the verifier-only correction above.
- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- Final `npm.cmd run test` — PASS, 37 files / 234 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run build` — PASS; Vite transformed 739 modules and produced the
  production bundle.
- `git diff --check` — PASS before final gates; line-ending notices only.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns integration and push decisions.
- Next: independent read-only Core QA must inspect the exact reported candidate SHA,
  rerun only the proportionate Core/T5 checks it needs, and report ACCEPT or REJECT to
  the coordinator before the frontend slice begins.

## 2026-07-16 — QA FIX PAUSED FOR CONTRACT UPDATE

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-CORE-QA-FIX-001`
- Base SHA: `3bf170ec252cc971b1f65d73b4649fabb2500dbb`
- Independent QA result: **REJECT**. The sole finding was the DEV
  `RuntimeQaSurface.replayScenario` hook assigning an offline replay terminal state
  directly into the mounted live runtime, bypassing visible UI and canonical play.
- Exact changed paths so far:
  - `src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.ts`
  - `src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts`
  - `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/THREAD_LOG.md`
- Fix: removed the replay imports, QA-surface type member, live callback, and all direct
  replay-state assignment. The pure functions in `qaScenario.ts` remain isolated unit
  helpers and are not exposed on `window`.
- Proof: the mounted QA surface has no `replayScenario`, `setState`, or `replaceState`;
  mutating the structured clone returned by `getState()` cannot alter runtime state.
- Targeted command:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts` — PASS, 3 files / 10 tests.
- Final typecheck/full test/build: intentionally not run. The coordinator paused the
  candidate after the user superseded the finite-queue Puzzle contract with normal-play
  seeded seven-bag, automatic-gravity, no-budget Puzzle rules.
- Commit/push: not performed.
- Blocker: `DESIGN.md` and `CURRENT_TASK.md` must be updated before any new Puzzle rule
  implementation is authorized.
- Next: retain this minimal QA fix in the dirty worktree and wait for the coordinator's
  revised bounded Puzzle slice.

## 2026-07-16 — NORMAL-PLAY PUZZLE CANDIDATE READY

- Task: `TETRIS-T5-PUZZLE-NORMALPLAY-002`
- Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`
- Base SHA: `79f60dd7a5c9ee16cb8a4c8fb8e958e2208e906e`
- Preserved intake delta: the three-path `TETRIS-T5-CORE-QA-FIX-001` removal of the
  mounted `replayScenario` state-injection path above.
- Candidate SHA: this single writer commit; exact SHA is reported immediately after
  commit creation.

No frontend/render production path, `puzzleProgress.ts`, coordinator document,
changelog, T3/T4 evidence, or QA archive was edited.

### Delivered behavior and production evidence

- Puzzle now changes only the stable starting board, level-owned seed, and
  canonical-board-empty success condition. It shares Marathon gravity, score, SRS,
  lock delay, entry delay, clear delay, soft/hard drop, and the continuously
  replenishing deterministic seven-bag.
- The engine does not read an authored Puzzle queue, piece budget, remaining count,
  or numeric difficulty. It does not emit `failed-budget`; an unsolved game continues
  until success, restart/exit, or ordinary `block-out`/`lock-out`, both mapped to
  `failed-top-out` for the Puzzle result surface.
- Each known Puzzle ID is bound to one exact stable nonzero seed. The first 84 pieces
  for every seed are frozen and verified as twelve complete consecutive seven-bags.
- The six original boards occupy 10/10/10/8/8/10 rows. Every board has 8–10 unique row
  shapes, four row densities (6/7/8/9 occupied cells), 7–8 covered-hole columns, and
  10–15 buried cavities. No board is a repeated floor template or single I-well.
- `puzzle-references.json` freezes two same-seed routes per level. Locked-piece counts
  are 35/35, 35/35, 30/30, 29/29, 34/34, and 30/30. The second routes differ at
  29/24/4/4/15/5 semantic lock indices and every pair has an intermediate canonical
  board-hash divergence.
- All twelve routes use all seven types, 9–11 landing x values, 19–30 effective
  rotations, 14–21 non-clearing locks, and 13–19 separated clear phases. They finish
  only when the canonical 40 × 10 board is empty.
- The authoritative verifier drives production `createInitialState` and public
  `dispatch` only. It verifies spawn type, every effective rotation, every horizontal
  movement path, hard-drop landing Y, clear count, delayed entry/clear resolution,
  terminal state, restart hash, route diversity, and frozen initial/final,
  command/event, and board-trace digests. The value 70 exists only as its safety guard.
- `GameRuntime.setReducedMotion(boolean)` forwards only the renderer option and does
  not rebuild or replace canonical state. Mounted DEV QA exposes a structured-clone
  read view and no replay, `setState`, or `replaceState` hook.

### Bounded authoring search evidence

- `search-puzzles.mjs` is an authoring helper only; its geometry proposals were not
  accepted until the TypeScript public-dispatch verifier passed.
- The initial one-hole-per-row prototype found 6/6 pairs quickly but was discarded
  because it violated the frozen no-repeated-floor-template rule.
- A fully random 1–4-hole prototype produced no Level 1 route within 120 seconds and
  was also discarded. The final generator uses staggered 1–5-cell cavity profiles,
  at least three row densities, and multiple covered holes.
- Successful bounded searches were:
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 0 18 4000 120000`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 1 12 4000 180000 7`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 2 16 4000 180000 0`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 3 16 4000 180000 0`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 4 20 4000 210000 0`
  - `node docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs 5 20 4000 240000 6`
- Bounded failure evidence was retained instead of weakening thresholds: early Level 2
  candidates found 32- and 24-lock first routes but no second route in 150 seconds;
  early Level 6 candidates found a 29-lock first route but no second route in 210
  seconds. Later candidate indices produced the accepted pairs.

### Commands actually run

- `node --check docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/search-puzzles.mjs` — PASS after the
  final helper change.
- Focused convergence command covering Core definitions/flow/campaign, runtime QA,
  runtime boundary, progress fixture, and presentation Next:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleFlow.test.ts src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts src/puzzleProgress.test.ts src/game/render/presentation.test.ts`
  — PASS, 19 files / 92 tests.
- Final focused stable-seed validation:
  `npm.cmd run test -- src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts` — PASS, 3 files / 16 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run typecheck` — PASS.
- Final `npm.cmd run test` — PASS, 37 files / 236 tests.
- Final `npm.cmd run build` — PASS; Vite transformed 738 modules and produced the
  production bundle.

### Deliberate compatibility debt for the frontend slice

- `puzzlePieceBudget` remains a deprecated state-field bridge and is always `null`.
- `puzzleQueue`/`puzzleQueueIndex` remain a deprecated generated-Next bridge: they
  mirror the shared queue at index zero and have no generation or terminal authority.
- `failed-budget`, `failed-invalid-spawn`, and the two matching event-reason literals
  remain type-only compatibility values; production Puzzle engine paths never emit them.
- `nextUnlockedLevelId` remains navigation/progress compatibility only and never
  controls Core availability. The frontend slice owns the all-levels-enabled UI and
  completion-only persistence migration.
- `PUZZLE_DEFINITIONS` exposes a deprecated type-only `difficulty` facade so the
  forbidden old `puzzleProgress.ts` compiles; runtime definition objects contain no
  numeric difficulty. Frontend must remove that read, then the facade can be deleted.
- `RACE_TARGET_LINES` remains the already documented frontend compile bridge; no
  Core/runtime rule reads it.

### Handoff

- Blocker: none.
- Commit: one candidate commit is created after final diff/path checks.
- Push: not performed; coordinator owns integration and push decisions.
- Next: independent read-only Core QA verifies the exact candidate SHA before the
  coordinator authorizes frontend integration.
