Original prompt: separate Tetris into E:\Proj\reproduction-tetris, diagnose the mixed Temple/Tetris history and local QA copies, then correct the tiny and overlapping Tetris presentation without changing accepted game rules.

## 2026-07-15

- Created standalone Tetris repository and retained QA clones under `.local/qa-archives`.
- Isolated stale pre-V1 `dist` outside the active repository.
- Confirmed `4c85828` is the last pure Tetris integration point; later commits are docs-only coordination changes.
- Confirmed the screenshots use the accepted V1 source, not an alternate version.
- Root cause: 718 px shell cap, 306 px board cap, 174 px three-mode rail, and five controls forced into 306 px.
- Implemented the bounded T4 desktop layout recovery: 380 × 760 at 1440 × 900,
  460 × 920 at 2048 × 1152, complete Chinese mode labels, stacked control
  glyphs/labels, and the corrected pause-height ratio.
- Final local gates passed once: typecheck, 36-file/234-test Vitest, build, and a
  19-capture browser matrix under `docs/qa/evidence/tetris-t4/`.
- Active TODO: independent QA, coordinator changelog integration, and one push.

## 2026-07-16 — T5 opened

- User rejected the T4 Mineral Shelf presentation and requested a full light cyan/light-blue rebuild with a dedicated three-mode entry page.
- Race changed from a 20-line finish to endless accelerating normal play; only explicit exit or top-out ends the run.
- Puzzle first changed to longer finite authored queues, then the user superseded that
  draft: current authority is normal automatic-gravity play on an authored starting
  board, a continuously replenishing deterministic seven-bag stream, no piece budget,
  and multiple valid solution routes per level.
- Root-cause audit found Puzzle soft drop can reach the floor but never lock because puzzle ticks return before grounded lock-delay handling.
- Preserved the rejected T4 follow-up on local branch `codex/tetris-t4-rejected-preservation` at `1362c664629b2a83f0659f836259b84c21750fee`, then returned to a clean `codex/tetris-recovery` tree.
- T5 uses the `4c85828` deterministic core/rule authority while retaining `dd7e31e` only as a historical ancestor.
- Core candidate `3bf170e` proved endless Race and repaired consecutive Puzzle locking,
  but independent QA rejected its live runtime replay-state injection. The injection
  deletion is retained uncommitted while the finite-queue Puzzle work is superseded.
- Revised Core candidate `630fb30` implements seeded normal play, twelve verified
  multi-route references, automatic gravity, continuous seven-bag input, and no budget
  terminal. Independent read-only QA accepted it after 22-file / 140-test focused
  verification and typecheck.
- Active TODO: implement and verify the original `青流方阵` Aqua Blueprint frontend,
  then one combined final gate/evidence pass and final QA.
- User removed `index.html` from the redesign scope; it remains unchanged as the Vite
  entry while page branding and accessibility copy are rebuilt under `src`.
- User clarified the product remains a browser HTML webpage, not a native app or PWA.
- Frontend candidate `b480e7d` and coordinator evidence child `9b7e552` passed the
  combined typecheck, 37-file / 237-test suite, build, five-viewport browser matrix,
  visible keyboard/touch scenarios, and visual review.
- Independent final QA rejected `9b7e552` on one fail-closed issue: DEV
  `__TETRIS_D4_QA__.collect()` exposes the runtime state object by reference. The
  bounded `TETRIS-T5-FINAL-QA-FIX-001` slice must return a detached snapshot, prove
  nested mutation isolation, and refresh final-SHA browser evidence before integration.

## 2026-07-17 — first T5 frontend rejected

- User rejected both the `青流方阵` name and the complete Aqua Blueprint page;
  candidate `b480e7d` and evidence child `9b7e552` remain local rejected history.
- The standalone snapshot-only fix was stopped before it changed any file. Its
  state-clone regression requirement moves into `TETRIS-T5-FRONTEND-REDESIGN-002`.
- Current frontend authority is plain-text `Tetris`, a clean light cyan/light-blue
  game interface, compact layered mode entrances, a non-overlapping Puzzle selector,
  one coherent game surface, and rounded ceramic cells. No commercial logo, font,
  product layout, or trade dress may be copied.

## 2026-07-17 — second T5 frontend rejected

- Candidate `c9135f3252abfa3bd6d7e94c5eb2e11fc3c72a18` completed typecheck,
  38 files / 238 tests, build, and bounded browser smoke, but the user rejected its
  full visual presentation rather than requesting a local polish pass.
- Independent review also found computed mobile statistic text at only 8–11 px and
  legacy player-facing `路线` copy. Those findings move into the replacement contract;
  the rejected rounded mode bands and ceramic cells are not repaired in place.
- Latest authority is light neo-tech minimal: one continuous 1+2 mode surface, precise
  thin edges, one cyan-to-blue phase seam, coherent Puzzle/game surfaces, and flat
  edge-lit plate cells. Grids, CAD/scanlines, decorative technical text, toy/glass
  styling, marketing heroes, settings lists, floating-card piles, and looping
  ornament are forbidden.
- The accepted endless Race, continuous seven-bag Puzzle, all-level access,
  lifecycle/accessibility behavior, and detached QA snapshot regression remain fixed.
- Next: commit the Slice E contract, authorize one bounded frontend writer, then route
  the exact candidate through independent QA before evidence, changelog, or push.

## 2026-07-17 — Slice E final evidence rejected with bounded fixes

- Neo-tech minimal candidate `f66c118` and compact-layout fix `f277c2a` passed writer
  gates and independent product QA. Coordinator evidence child `221c821` contains 16
  first-viewport captures and passed the final 38-file / 238-test suite and build.
- Final visual QA found one product defect: at 360 × 800 the Puzzle goal is visibly
  ellipsized as `清空完整棋...` instead of `清空完整棋盘`.
- Final static QA found one evidence-integrity defect: Windows CRLF bytes were hashed
  before Git normalized `browser-evidence.json` to LF, so raw Git-blob verification
  matched 17/18 entries even though the local working tree matched 18/18.
- All other reviewed visuals, five-viewport geometry, 44 px controls, 12/14/18 px
  type floors, lifecycle teardown, detached snapshots, normal-gravity Puzzle locks,
  public-keyboard success, endless Race, and evidence scope passed.
- Next: one CSS/log writer fixes only the narrow Puzzle statistic allocation; after
  independent product QA, the coordinator regenerates all formal evidence with
  explicit LF output and repeats final exact-commit QA before changelog or push.

## 2026-07-17 — fifteen-level multi-color direction opened

- Slice F candidate `56288cd` fixed the 360 × 800 Puzzle goal using only a 40/60
  narrow statistic-column allocation plus the frontend log. Independent browser QA
  accepted the exact SHA at 360/390/844: complete `清空完整棋盘`, 18 px value text,
  44 px controls, one canvas, zero DOM cells, no overflow, and no console errors.
- The user then extended the product target before release: player-facing `马拉松`
  becomes `经典`; pieces use a more varied original multi-hue palette; Puzzle grows
  from six to at least fifteen all-enabled levels; and every prefilled board uses
  multiple piece colors.
- Public descriptions of comparable falling-block products informed only the abstract
  split between continuous classic play and a larger level library. No external level
  mask, name, palette mapping, interface, or trade dress is copied.
- Core preflight confirmed that normal gravity, continuous seven-bag replenishment,
  board-empty success, top-out, and progress derivation are already level-count
  independent. Slice G therefore owns fifteen definitions, deterministic multi-color
  canonical boards, nine new original masks/seeds, and thirty public-dispatch route
  proofs without changing engine/random/runtime/frontend code.
- After independent Core QA, Slice H owns visible `经典` copy, the frozen original
  mineral-signal seven-color theme, and a responsive fifteen-entry library. Formal
  evidence and raw-blob LF correction are deferred until both new slices pass QA.
- No push is eligible from the rejected six-level evidence chain.

## 2026-07-17 — Slice G fifteen-level Core accepted

- Core candidate `48a229e` extends the production library to exactly fifteen levels,
  retains the first six IDs, seeds, normalized occupancy masks, and two placement
  streams, and adds nine original seeds/masks with thirty total production
  `createInitialState` plus public-`dispatch` solution routes.
- Every authored starting board now uses all seven piece types through a deterministic
  salted color pass that is independent from gameplay randomization. Independent QA
  confirmed the first 84 pieces remain twelve complete seven-bags for all fifteen
  seeds and that generation continues beyond that horizon.
- Independent Core QA accepted the exact candidate: new levels each use 10 occupied
  rows, 10 normalized row shapes, 4 density classes, 5–9 covered-cavity columns, and
  11–14 buried holes; pairwise new-mask Hamming distance is at least 24; routes use
  29–35 locks and every route pair diverges in an intermediate canonical board hash.
- Writer gates passed: typecheck, 38 files / 248 tests, 739-module production build,
  and the explicit 15-level / 30-route verifier. QA reran only bounded target tests,
  verified reference SHA-256
  `F1A05DB8CA31B6833FCF09F096A5C726E29D5B95274897A2A7E0259A5ED7696C`, and left the
  worktree clean.
- Slice H is now the sole active writer boundary: visible `经典`, the frozen original
  seven-color mineral-signal theme, and the responsive fifteen-entry level library.
  Core definitions, routes, engine, randomizer, `index.html`, and formal evidence stay
  read-only until frontend QA accepts its exact candidate.

## 2026-07-17 — Slice H functional candidate visually superseded

- Slice H candidate `248ca89` completed `经典`, dynamic fifteen-level binding, 3 × 5
  desktop/844 and two-column mobile selectors, canonical first/eighth/fifteenth UI
  starts, and seven-color Board/Next/silhouettes. Writer gates passed after its last
  source fix: typecheck, 40 files / 252 tests with one intentional skipped helper,
  739-module build, and the five-viewport browser matrix.
- The user rejected this finish before independent acceptance: the page must look more
  premium, the current blocks are specifically ugly, and every piece must use bright
  color. `248ca89` remains a clean fallback only; no evidence or push may use it.
- Read-only visual diagnosis found the ordinary feel came from table-wall repetition,
  empty detail space, repeated rounded HUD cards, generic segmented controls, and the
  muted double-outlined minos reading as plastic/candy at mobile scale.
- Slice I now owns one bounded frontend/render replacement. It preserves all accepted
  behavior and responsive geometry while introducing the exact bright luminous-spectrum
  mapping, a flat precision-slab Pixi primitive, tighter premium hierarchy, coherent
  HUD/control surfaces, and a filled final mobile grid row. Core, dependencies,
  `index.html`, coordinator docs after this contract, and formal evidence remain
  read-only for the writer.
- The user then broadened the page palette itself: premium technology color is not
  restricted to light blue/green. Slice I therefore uses an ice-light spectral-glass
  system with controlled cyan, cobalt, violet, and small coral state accents while
  keeping the separate seven-piece bright mapping and avoiding a dark/random rainbow.

## 2026-07-17 — Slice I rejected; authored endgames and deep natural theme opened

- Slice I checkpoint `e552b3c` completed the bright spectral surface, renderer, and
  five-viewport writer gates immediately before the next user review. It remains clean
  and local, but is rejected as a release candidate and will not receive QA, evidence,
  changelog integration, or push.
- The user identified three replacement requirements: remove the plastic color feel
  in favor of a deeper, tenser, mutually compatible natural palette; rebuild Puzzle
  boards as rule-stacked endgames whose colors correspond to actual source
  tetrominoes; and remove redundant descriptions from the classic-game interface.
- Read-only Core audit confirmed the current generator randomly excavates occupancy
  masks and then independently assigns a salted seven-bag color to every occupied
  cell. It proves neither a legal stacking history nor four-cell color/shape
  provenance, so all fifteen masks and thirty solution references must be replaced.
- Slice J now owns frozen setup seeds plus explicit `{ type, rotation, x }` histories.
  Every landing row is derived by public-command hard drop from an empty board, setup
  performs zero line clears, and the derived Puzzle board must preserve each source
  tetromino as an exact four-cell same-material component.
- Official descriptions of ordinary falling/rotation, Perfect Clear, and
  multiple-solution Tetrimino puzzles informed only the abstract objective and
  validation principles. No external mask, color mapping, level name, UI composition,
  or route is copied.
- After independent Core QA, Slice K applies the exact `暮海矿物` tokens and coordinated
  garnet/sea-pine/ochre/storm/moss/rock-violet/lake piece mapping, removes BlurFilter
  aura and glass effects, and reduces visible copy to names, controls, statistics,
  completion, and the immediate board-clear objective.

## 2026-07-17 — authored endgames generated; stale QA replay isolated

- Slice J generated fifteen legal zero-clear setup histories and thirty successful
  public-dispatch routes. Its targeted production verifier passed 63 tests, with the
  reference JSON rebuilt from the new signed histories.
- The first complete suite passed 39 files / 251 tests and failed only the internal
  `PUZZLE_CHALLENGE_QA_ROUTE`, which still contained the rejected former first-level
  placements. Typecheck passed; build and the final complete reference verification
  correctly stopped pending the last source fix.
- Slice J-R is a separate exact-path migration for only `qaScenario.ts`, its direct
  test if required, and a runtime workstream log. It may update the frozen 35-lock
  public-command fixture but may not change Puzzle rules, runtime behavior, Core,
  frontend, or `index.html`.

## 2026-07-17 — authored mid-game endgames accepted; Slice K opened

- Final Core/runtime source SHA `26ef004` passed one complete post-fix sequence:
  typecheck, 39 files / 252 tests, 739-module production build, and the explicit
  15-setup / 30-route verifier with 49 tests.
- Independent read-only QA accepted `50be21d..676d804`. It confirmed every level is a
  frozen mid-game snapshot produced from an independent seeded seven-bag and 16–22
  legal placements, rather than a random mask; all source-piece shapes and colors are
  exact, pairwise board Hamming distance is at least 24, and all thirty routes satisfy
  the strengthened diversity thresholds.
- Reference SHA-256 is
  `4c8f9fac3451b2e888c5560126b75c5cd949c7e1a947f04274698e93c0171bec` at 263,980
  bytes with zero CRLF. The J-R first-level QA fixture exactly matches the signed
  35-placement route and changes no Race or production dispatch behavior.
- Slice K is now the sole active product boundary. It owns player-visible `经典`, the
  exact coordinated `暮海矿物` palette, matte anodized Board/Next cells, and concise
  names/controls/statistics/objective copy. Core, runtime, `index.html`, dependencies,
  coordinator docs, changelog, and formal evidence remain read-only to its writer.

## 2026-07-17 — Slice K rejected; typography and divider repair opened

- Slice K source `1b1bfdb` passed writer typecheck, 253 tests, build, action client,
  and a five-viewport matrix. Independent visual review accepted the deep mineral
  palette, matte cells, all fifteen distinct multi-color boards, geometry, contrast,
  lifecycle, and concise `经典` presentation.
- Independent QA rejected three frozen-contract deviations: portrait/narrow/844
  landscape hide visible `Next` and the keyboard map; `surface-in` travels 6 px rather
  than at most 4 px; and the renderer's line-clear sweep lasts the full 200 ms phase
  rather than 120–160 ms. ARIA does not replace required visible copy.
- The user's screenshot also proves the statistic grid's generic odd/even border rules
  produce a half horizontal divider and stray vertical segment. The repair freezes
  role-based Puzzle rows so level and objective span both columns around the middle
  placed/cleared pair.
- Slice K-R additionally adopts the open-source Google Fonts combination `Space
  Grotesk` + `Noto Sans SC` through CSS v2 with `display=swap` and system fallbacks.
  It keeps `Tetris` as plain text and leaves `index.html`, dependencies, Core,
  runtime, input/audio/storage, and formal evidence unchanged.

## 2026-07-17 — cohesive dimensional tetromino repair added

- The user's gameplay screenshot shows that the accepted colors are still rendered as
  isolated flat tiles: every mino retains a complete perimeter and a wide well gap,
  so a four-cell piece does not read as one shape.
- Slice K-R now also owns a renderer-only cohesive component pass. Same-material
  orthogonal neighbors bridge the gap, hide full internal outlines, and retain at most
  a hairline seam. Active/Next/Ghost use their exact canonical four-cell grouping;
  locked boards group same-material neighbors without adding ownership to Core.
- Dimensionality is limited to one directional mineral bevel: low-alpha signal on
  exposed top/left edges and the material dark edge on bottom/right edges. Exact colors
  remain frozen and plastic gloss, white highlights, glow, blur, glass, double rings,
  and detached unit shadows remain forbidden.
- Canonical Puzzle silhouettes close their old cell gaps while keeping at most one SVG
  path per piece type. The expanded allowlist adds only App silhouette source/tests and
  theme/renderer presentation paths; engine, board data, runtime, `index.html`,
  dependencies, coordinator evidence, and other product subsystems stay unchanged.

## 2026-07-17 — T5 cohesive mineral release candidate accepted

- Final source `effb353` presents plain-text `Tetris`, player-facing `经典`, endless
  accelerating Race, and fifteen all-enabled legal mid-game Puzzle endgames with a
  continuous seeded seven-bag and two verified public-command routes per level.
- Board, active, Next, Ghost, silhouettes, and locked stacks now use cohesive mineral
  components with suppressed internal borders and one restrained directional bevel;
  the exact deep natural seven-material mapping remains fixed.
- Space Grotesk and Noto Sans SC load through Google Fonts with a geometry-safe system
  fallback. Statistic dividers use explicit semantic roles, and every required mobile
  view retains visible Next, keyboard context, complete goals, and 44 px controls.
- Final post-source gates passed: typecheck; 40 test files with 39 passed / 1 skipped;
  258 tests with 256 passed / 2 skipped; 739-module build; action client; loaded-font
  and blocked-font five-viewport matrices.
- Independent source QA accepted candidate tip `ba5d387`. Formal evidence `c0832e4`
  contains 23 captures tied to source `effb353`; evidence QA inspected 23/23 at original
  detail and reproduced 25/25 raw Git blob hashes with zero CRLF manifest drift.
- `index.html`, dependencies, historical T3/T4 evidence, and other game repositories
  were not changed by the final frontend/evidence repairs. Next action: coordinator
  push of `codex/tetris-recovery`.

## 2026-07-18 — bright divided-facet refinement and entry countdown accepted

- Preserved the mature T5 composition while making each tetromino read as one cohesive
  silhouette with a larger gap between pieces, a narrower internal groove, visible
  per-cell facets, and restrained directional depth. Renderer geometry source is
  `acaf405`.
- Retoned only page/state/piece colors, shadow, `color-scheme`, and action ink into the
  exact light `雾昼矿物` system at `fd5f901`. Layout, typography scale, dividers,
  controls, copy, phase motion, and renderer geometry did not change.
- Shortened the shared grounded lock delay from 30 to 18 fixed ticks at `f0ec47c`.
  Direct tests prove tick 17 remains movable and resets the timer while tick 18 locks;
  independent Core QA confirmed Classic, Race, and Puzzle share the same deterministic
  branch and that the 15-reset cap and all other rules remain unchanged.
- Added one board-local `3 / 2 / 1` countdown on initial mode entry at `7f0b766`.
  Each digit lasts exactly one second; canonical state stays `ready`, input is disabled,
  and the runtime starts exactly once after `1`. Repair `48176fe` also fail-closes the
  public and DEV-QA restart/mode/Puzzle-selection paths during the gate.
- Final post-repair gates passed: typecheck; 40 files with 39 passed / 1 skipped;
  262 tests with 260 passed / 2 skipped; 739-module build; prescribed action client;
  and a five-viewport exact-source browser matrix.
- Independent Core and frontend/browser cross-QA both accepted with no open finding.
  Evidence `7d37418` binds 24 captures to source `48176fe` and log tip `d292b15`, with
  26/26 matching checksums, one canvas, zero DOM cells, zero unexpected browser errors,
  and explicit digit-3 / ready / zero-piece / disabled-input countdown proof.
- `index.html`, dependencies, Puzzle boards/routes, and every separate game repository
  remain unchanged. The branch is eligible for coordinator push.

## 2026-07-18 — T6 three independent modes accepted

- Replaced the overlapping Classic/Race progression with three separate objectives:
  Classic is fixed-speed chain scoring, player-facing `生存` is fixed-speed endurance
  against permanent rising bedrock, and Puzzle remains fifteen authored board-clearing
  endgames with continuous seeded seven-bag play.
- Classic now exposes `连消`: consecutive clearing pieces score the fixed base table
  plus `50 × (combo - 1)`, while a non-clearing lock breaks the chain. Classic and
  Survival remain at 48 ticks per automatic cell with no player-facing level system.
- Survival retains internal key `race` only for compatibility. Every five cumulative
  cleared lines resolves normally, then shifts the board up and appends one full
  `BEDROCK_CELL` row. Bedrock blocks pieces, never clears, renders through its own
  coordinated mineral material, and accumulates until top-out.
- Final source is `5a3c35a`; Core source is `34184cb`; formal evidence is `a26d989`.
  Final gates passed typecheck, 261 passed / 2 skipped tests across 40 files, the
  739-module build, and one 24-capture browser matrix.
- Independent Core, combined browser, and evidence QA all accepted with no finding.
  Public-command browser replay reached 24 lines / 4 bedrock rows on desktop and
  portrait; formal evidence has zero browser errors and 26/26 matching checksums.
- `index.html`, dependencies, Puzzle definitions/references, and separate game
  repositories were not changed. Next action: coordinator push of
  `codex/tetris-recovery`.

## 2026-07-18 — Survival bedrock recolor accepted

- Product source `4b27a98` changes only the permanent bedrock material to a restrained
  warm rock-brown, separating it from the cool blue/teal playable pieces without
  changing geometry or rules.
- Both face colors retain 5.455291:1 / 3.248488:1 contrast against the board well.
- Final typecheck, 261 passed / 2 skipped tests, 739-module build, action client, and
  24-capture browser matrix passed. Independent static and visual/evidence QA accepted
  with no finding; evidence `367a443` reproduced 26/26 checksums and zero errors.

## 2026-07-18 — T7 timed Survival and motion accepted

- Final product source `356440c` replaces five-line bedrock generation with timed
  pressure: 40 seconds initially, minus two seconds every five lines, ten-second floor;
  each five-line reward removes one existing bottom bedrock row and resets the timer.
- Classic and Survival use the same ten-line progressive gravity curve; Puzzle keeps
  its accepted fixed cadence and all fifteen levels / thirty references unchanged.
- Removed the mode and action-sheet decorative bars, added concise complete rules,
  direct fall/countdown statistics, restrained entry/focus feedback, and brief
  rise/removal stack motion with explicit reduced-motion suppression.
- Final gates passed typecheck, 267 passed / 2 skipped tests, the 739-module build, and
  a 25-capture browser matrix with zero unexpected errors. Evidence `9ef2708` proves
  rise at 2763 ticks / one `BBBBBBBBBB` row and reward at five lines / zero rows /
  zero pressure / 38 seconds; 27/27 hashes match.
- Independent static and visual QA accepted with no P0–P3 finding. `index.html`,
  dependencies, Puzzle data, ordinary material tokens, and separate repositories did
  not change. Next action: coordinator push of `codex/tetris-recovery`.

## 2026-07-18 — T8 interface and Survival refinement complete

- Replaced the home 1+2 table with a responsive stepped mode field and replaced the
  Puzzle stair glyph with a stable T tetromino.
- Rebuilt Puzzle selection with a prominent return action, canonical per-level board
  thumbnails, a larger selected-board preview, and no library/home `目标：清空棋盘`.
- Browser inspection found compact SVGs were inheriting the later large-preview size;
  the small container clipped most of each board. A higher-specificity compact size
  now renders the complete canonical board.
- Changed Survival pressure to 20 seconds initially, minus one second per five lines,
  with a ten-second floor. Targeted core/runtime tests pass.
- Rebound the v3 local result leaderboard: Classic ranks by score and Survival by
  cleared lines. Duplicate terminal callbacks are suppressed per run.
- Added an `index.html` Tetris Loading screen with reduced-motion behavior and a
  post-paint handoff.
- Final exact-source gates pass: 39 test files passed / 1 skipped, 268 tests passed /
  2 skipped, TypeScript plus a 741-module production build, and the prescribed web-game
  action client.
- Browser checks passed at 1280 × 720, 390 × 844, and 844 × 390 with no console or
  page errors, no viewport overflow, visible 44 px return/start actions, correct full
  Puzzle previews, reduced-motion suppression, post-paint Loading removal, and real
  Classic/Survival top-out records rendered with their correct primary metric.
- No open implementation TODO remains for this request. Generated browser captures are
  local QA artifacts only and are not product source.

## 2026-07-19 — T9 candidate: Survival descent and Puzzle archive

- Survival now opens with five warm-mineral bedrock rows; restart restores the same
  canonical opening. Pressure is `15 → 8` seconds and both the pressure interval and
  gravity table advance once per three cleared lines. Each boundary removes one bottom
  bedrock row when available, while Puzzle remains at 48 ticks and Classic retains its
  ten-line progression.
- The home `Tetris` heading is now the primary identity. The Puzzle selector is rebuilt
  as a compact `解谜档案` board with colored canonical thumbnails and a dark selected
  preview; all fifteen levels remain enabled.
- Candidate range: contract `502f978`, core/runtime `0ebb0cb`, frontend `7910e91`.
  Final gates: typecheck PASS; 40 files / 269 tests passed with 2 skipped; 741-module
  production build PASS. Browser inspection has zero error output and visibly proves
  the home title, archive layout, and a live Survival state with 5 bedrock rows,
  15-second interval, and 48 ticks per cell.
- Next action: independent Core and visual/browser QA of `502f978..7910e91`; do not
  push before its acceptance.

## 2026-07-19 — T9 Puzzle archive cleanup candidate

- Removed the selection-dot ornament and all fifteen list thumbnails. The selected
  canonical board remains the sole preview, preserving focus, touch size, and all
  enabled level selection behavior.
- Source checkpoint `15e6412` follows contract `575a81c`. Typecheck, the full 269
  passed / 2 skipped suite, and the 741-module build passed. Browser inspection shows
  no tile dots or miniatures and retains the selected large preview with no errors.
- Candidate is now `502f978..15e6412`; independent Core and visual/browser QA remain
  required before push. The proposed immutable-cell and expiring-piece Puzzle redesign
  remains intentionally unimplemented pending a precise rule decision.
