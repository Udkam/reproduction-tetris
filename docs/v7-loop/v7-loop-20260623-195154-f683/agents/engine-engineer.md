# Agent Log: engine-engineer

Agent: engine-engineer
Task clarity: partial
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: v7 can introduce a versioned engine layer while keeping legacy replay acceptance during transition.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own state model, actions, deterministic mechanism rules, and server-compatible replay.

## Decisions made

- Add versioned replay and richer state keys before adding complex mechanics.
- Implement multi-agent and time echoes on a tick model.
- Keep recursive rooms bounded and replay-first.
- Stage 4 added the v7 metadata/state contract directly to the shared engine types so client, server, solver, and audits agree.
- Stage 4 implemented deterministic `timeShadow` state: delayed player position, optional player/crate blocking, optional plate pressure, and state-key participation.
- Stage 4 added `blockedReason` plumbing but kept the existing public move API compatible.

## Files touched

- `src/engine/types.ts`
- `src/engine/level.ts`
- `src/engine/rules.ts`
- `src/web/game.ts`
- `src/web/render.ts`
- `src/web/styles.css`
- `server/index.ts`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- Client/server replay drift if structured tokens are not accepted by the backend.
- `chain`, `spatialSwap`, and `recursiveRoom` are typed config surfaces only after Stage 4; concrete gameplay rules must follow before final acceptance.

## Review notes

- Server validation must reject invalid v7 actions and preserve old rejection behavior.
- Stage 4 verification passed old replay paths plus a dedicated timeShadow engine check.

## Next handoff

- Level and frontend agents can start the 15-level vertical slice using typed v7 notes and `timeShadow`; engine still owes concrete spatial-swap / recursive / chain rule hooks.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: engine-engineer
Task clarity: partial
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: The redesign slice can cap recursion depth and branch count to keep replay deterministic.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Engine implementation must prioritize worldline split, recursive layer path, swap preview, sync conflict, echo queue, and rule socket state.
- The next runtime target is 20 levels, so engine features should be minimal but real rather than broad and shallow.
- State keys must include branch, layer path, socket contents, swap state, and echo history where applicable.

Files touched:

- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/12-redesign-spec.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/13-puzzle-grammar.md`

Risks:

- Server replay drift if branch/layer/socket actions are not versioned clearly.

Review notes:

- Do not bypass server replay validation; extend it.

Next handoff:

- Solver engineer should define slice-mode verification before runtime levels are accepted.

## Stage 9B Mechanism Proof Patch

Agent: engine-engineer
Task clarity: partial
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: This patch improves the current runtime but does not reverse the Stage 9 product rejection.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Added a minimal deterministic spatial-swap rule: stepping on a configured trigger swaps crates between two configured exchange points.
- Kept the rule coordinate-driven and replay-safe instead of adding hidden map semantics.
- Added recursive-core visual marking and chain-state progress recording as partial affordances, not final nested-room/branch simulation.

Files touched:

- `src/engine/types.ts`
- `src/engine/rules.ts`
- `src/engine/v7Levels.ts`
- `src/web/progress.ts`
- `src/web/render.ts`
- `src/web/styles.css`
- `src/web/ui.ts`
- `scripts/audit-levels.ts`

Risks:

- Recursive-room remains visual/metadata support only.
- The accepted redesign slice still needs worldline split, recursive layer path, and rule sockets.

Review notes:

- `audit:levels` now includes an active spatial-swap requirement and behavior probe.
- `verify`, API replay, and UI smoke all passed after `v7-033` became an active swap level.

Next handoff:

- Use this proof as implementation evidence, but replace the rejected runtime in the next slice rather than polishing it further.
