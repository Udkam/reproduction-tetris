# Agent Log: qa-reviewer

Agent: qa-reviewer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: passing current baseline tests is not v7 acceptance.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own negative review, evidence requirements, failure loops, and final acceptance.

## Decisions made

- Do not accept typecheck/build alone.
- Visual screenshots, UI audit, content audit, and level audit are hard gates.
- Every stage must commit and push after verification.

## Files touched

- Stage 1 docs only.

## Risks

- jsdom UI smoke can pass while real visual layout is broken.
- Existing `smoke:ui` passes current 3D levels with `crates=0`; v7 visual and UI audits must close this blind spot.

## Review notes

- Final report must list failed or skipped checks explicitly.
- Stage 1 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, and `smoke:ui`.
- Stage 2 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, `build`, and a `tsx` catalog check showing no exposed `3d*` or `is3D` levels.
- Stage 3 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, `build`, and a temporary DOM audit showing the new command deck, chapter map, codex, records, settings, and no visible `立体演示` / `2.5D` entry.
- Stage 3 negative finding: this is a shell/art milestone only. It does not satisfy the final 70-level, new-mechanic, real-browser visual, or content-audit gates.
- Stage 3 negative finding: temporary DOM audit initially failed due PowerShell pipe encoding of Chinese regex. The re-test used Unicode escapes and passed; repo source content was confirmed as UTF-8 with Node.
- Stage 4 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, dedicated `timeShadow` engine check, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, and `build`.
- Stage 4 negative finding: `chain`, `spatialSwap`, and `recursiveRoom` are not complete gameplay yet; only typed config surfaces exist.
- Stage 4 negative finding: no final audit scripts or visual screenshots yet; those remain hard gates.
- Stage 5 verification passed after two fixes: unescaped apostrophe in `v7Levels.ts`, and old `l1` hardcode in `smoke-api`.
- Stage 5 negative finding: current catalog is 15/70, so final level count acceptance is not met.
- Stage 5 negative finding: spatial swap, recursion, and chain-state chapters are not playable yet.
- Stage 5 negative finding: real-browser visual screenshot smoke and mobile checks are still not implemented.

## Next handoff

- Stage 5 may be committed and pushed after final re-run. Next stage must expand to 70 and add final audit commands instead of polishing only the slice.
