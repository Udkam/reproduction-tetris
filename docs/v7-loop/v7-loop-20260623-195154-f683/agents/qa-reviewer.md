# Agent Log: qa-reviewer

Agent: qa-reviewer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: passing current baseline tests is not v7 acceptance.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own negative review, evidence requirements, failure loops, and final acceptance.

## Decisions made

- Do not accept typecheck/build alone.
- Visual screenshots, UI audit, content audit, and level audit are hard gates.
- Every stage must commit and push after verification.

## Files touched

- Stage 1 docs only.

## Risks

- jsdom UI smoke can pass while real visual layout is broken.
- Existing `smoke:ui` passes current 3D levels with `crates=0`; v7 visual and UI audits must close this blind spot.

## Review notes

- Final report must list failed or skipped checks explicitly.
- Stage 1 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, and `smoke:ui`.
- Stage 2 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, `build`, and a `tsx` catalog check showing no exposed `3d*` or `is3D` levels.
- Stage 3 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, `build`, and a temporary DOM audit showing the new command deck, chapter map, codex, records, settings, and no visible `立体演示` / `2.5D` entry.
- Stage 3 negative finding: this is a shell/art milestone only. It does not satisfy the final 70-level, new-mechanic, real-browser visual, or content-audit gates.
- Stage 3 negative finding: temporary DOM audit initially failed due PowerShell pipe encoding of Chinese regex. The re-test used Unicode escapes and passed; repo source content was confirmed as UTF-8 with Node.
- Stage 4 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, dedicated `timeShadow` engine check, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, and `build`.
- Stage 4 negative finding: `chain`, `spatialSwap`, and `recursiveRoom` are not complete gameplay yet; only typed config surfaces exist.
- Stage 4 negative finding: no final audit scripts or visual screenshots yet; those remain hard gates.
- Stage 5 verification passed after two fixes: unescaped apostrophe in `v7Levels.ts`, and old `l1` hardcode in `smoke-api`.
- Stage 5 negative finding: current catalog is 15/70, so final level count acceptance is not met.
- Stage 5 negative finding: spatial swap, recursion, and chain-state chapters are not playable yet.
- Stage 5 negative finding: real-browser visual screenshot smoke and mobile checks are still not implemented.
- Stage 6 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `audit:levels`, `audit:ui`, `audit:content`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, and `build`.
- Stage 6 level count gate passed: runtime exposes exactly 70 v7 levels with the requested 8+8+8+8+8+8+8+8+6 chapter distribution.
- Stage 6 negative finding: `audit:levels` emits a warning that all 70 levels rely on replay/manual status; advanced chapters need sample-play review after screenshots exist.
- Stage 6 negative finding: spatial swap, recursive room, and chain-state depth is documented as replay/manual scenario coverage, not yet a full mechanism-specific solver/rules pass.
- Stage 6 fixed finding: duplicate exact helper-generated level signatures were caught by `audit:levels` and removed before verification.
- Stage 7 verification passed: `smoke:visual` generated all 15 required screenshots in the run screenshots directory.
- Stage 7 fixed finding: mobile screenshot QA initially caught the `知道了` intro button collapsing vertically; `src/web/styles.css` was patched and visual smoke was rerun.
- Stage 7 negative finding: screenshots prove the views render and are not blank, but they do not resolve the advanced-mechanic depth issue for spatial swap, recursive room, or chain state.
- Stage 7 negative finding: `audit:levels` still warns that all 70 levels rely on replay/manual status.
- Stage 8 verification passed: `typecheck`, `verify`, `audit:levels`, `audit:ui`, `audit:content`, `smoke:api`, `smoke:ui`, `smoke:visual`, and `build`.
- Stage 8 fixed finding: level pages now surface mechanism chips and blocked-move feedback, and `audit:ui` checks those affordances.
- Stage 8 negative finding: feedback polish does not resolve the deeper advanced-mechanic implementation gap.

## Next handoff

- Stage 8 may be committed and pushed after final status check. Next loop should focus on concrete rule-depth implementation for spatial swap, recursive room, and chain-state, plus sample-play review of advanced chapters.

## Stage 9 Redesign Reset

Agent: qa-reviewer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: User screenshot review is authoritative evidence for product failure.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Current v7 is failed for product acceptance even though Stage 8 commands passed.
- Redesign implementation is blocked until reference study and redesign docs are committed.
- Highest QA standard for the next loop is: 参考优秀系统谜题游戏的设计方法，从机制系统和关卡语言出发，重做 Driftbox，而不是给旧推箱子项目套科幻皮肤。

Files touched:

- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/09-iteration-log.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/10-acceptance-report.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/11-reference-study.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/12-redesign-spec.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/13-puzzle-grammar.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/14-ui-redesign-spec.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`

Risks:

- A docs-only reset can become performative if implementation later mutates the old UI instead of replacing it.

Review notes:

- Negative finding: current homepage, chapter map, chamber board, role, and level language are rejected.
- Negative finding: current screenshot set is historical evidence only, not acceptance evidence.
- Gate for next implementation: 20-level slice with real recursive/worldline/time/swap/sync/rule-block coverage and screenshots that no longer resemble the rejected route.

Next handoff:

- Commit and push the Stage 9 reset checkpoint, then begin implementation from the new specs.

## Stage 9B Mechanism Proof Patch

Agent: qa-reviewer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: Passing current-runtime tests is still not final product acceptance after the Stage 9 reset.
Proceed decision: proceed

Decisions made:

- Accept the spatial-swap behavior probe as real technical progress.
- Keep final acceptance blocked because the runtime has not been replaced with the accepted 20-level redesign slice.

Files touched:

- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/09-iteration-log.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/10-acceptance-report.md`
- `docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/06-level-design-matrix.md`

Risks:

- The current screenshots are improved but still belong to the rejected route.
- Recursive-room is not yet a full nested-room simulation.

Review notes:

- Full command suite passed after the Stage 9B patch.
- `08-spatial-swap-033.png` shows visible swap trigger/node markers.
- `09-recursive-041.png` shows the recursive-core marker.

Next handoff:

- Commit and push Stage 9B, then continue with the accepted redesign slice instead of declaring the current runtime final.
