# Agent Log: product-designer

Agent: product-designer
Task clarity: clear
Capability fit: good
Questions needed: none
Assumptions: v7 replaces the current user-facing product, not only the board renderer.
Proceed decision: proceed

## Responsibility

Own product flow, screens, navigation, progress surfaces, and acceptance framing.

## Decisions made

- Home must become a command deck, not a title plus level list.
- Chapter selection uses a star map / node graph.
- Completion, challenge records, settings, and mechanism archive are required screens.
- Stage 2 copy now states v6 is retired rather than current success.

## Files touched

- `README.md`
- `claude.md`
- Stage docs and `codex.md`

## Risks

- UI may remain too close to v6 if only colors change.

## Review notes

- QA must compare final screenshots against current v6 to confirm the product visibly changed.

## Next handoff

- Frontend and art agents use this flow as the screen contract.
