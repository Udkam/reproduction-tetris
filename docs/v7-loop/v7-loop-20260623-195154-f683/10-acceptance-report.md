# Acceptance Report

Status: redesign reset in progress, not final accepted.

RUN_ID: `v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683`

## Current Stage 9 Status

- Product acceptance: failed for the previous v7 route.
- Runtime catalog: still technically exposes the rejected 70-level v7 checkpoint until the next implementation stage replaces it.
- Technical baseline before reset: Stage 8 commands passed, but that is no longer sufficient product acceptance.
- New accepted target: a rebuilt 20-level vertical slice using the redesign grammar before any renewed 70-level expansion.
- v6 2.5D status: retired from user-facing runtime and treated as failed/archive context.
- Current v7 skinning status: failed as a product direction and must not be extended.

## Failure Finding

```text
[FAIL] Current v7 product acceptance
Evidence: Screenshot review found the homepage still resembles title/progress/buttons/cards, the chapter map is still card-like, the chamber still resembles old tile Sokoban, the role still inherits the small-person/Pip lineage, and the level set does not show enough system-puzzle depth.
Root cause: The route prioritized catalog expansion, audit passing, and dark sci-fi styling before proving a new mechanism language and UI architecture.
Fix plan: Stop expanding current 70-level data. Complete reference study and redesign docs, then replace the public runtime with a new 20-level vertical slice centered on recursive space, worldline split, time echo, spatial swap, sync drones, and rule blocks.

Re-test: npm run audit:content; UTF-8/mojibake marker check; QA negative review; later full command gate after implementation
```

## Redesign Documents

- `11-reference-study.md`: completed before implementation.
- `12-redesign-spec.md`: completed before implementation.
- `13-puzzle-grammar.md`: completed before implementation.
- `14-ui-redesign-spec.md`: completed before implementation.
- `15-vertical-slice-20-report.md`: planned slice report, not implemented.

## Required Next Runtime Gate

The next accepted runtime checkpoint is not "70 levels still pass." It is:

- New quantum experiment console home.
- New worldline/star graph map.
- New chamber experiment panel.
- New non-human quantum drone state component.
- New 20-level vertical slice with stored replay verification.
- At least one accepted level each for recursion, worldline split, time echo, spatial swap, multi-drone sync, and rule blocks.
- Updated visual smoke screenshots including a character state sheet.

## Known Non-Final Items

- Runtime has not yet been replaced with the redesign slice.
- Current screenshot set belongs to the rejected v7 route and is no longer final acceptance evidence.
- Engine support for worldline split, recursive layer path, and rule sockets needs implementation.
- The rejected 70-level runtime now has a deterministic spatial-swap trigger probe and visible local chain-state recording, but this does not make that runtime product-accepted.
- `audit:levels` and `verify` still target the rejected 70-level checkpoint until the implementation stage updates them.
- Existing docs may still contain historical mojibake in old stage excerpts; new redesign docs must remain UTF-8 clean.

## Screenshot Path

```text
docs/v7-loop/v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683/screenshots/
```

Current screenshot set is historical/rejected evidence only. The redesign slice must regenerate:

- new home console;
- worldline star graph;
- level 1;
- portal/link level;
- sync level;
- time echo level;
- spatial swap level;
- recursive chamber level;
- misdirection/worldline level;
- character state sheet;
- victory collapse;
- mobile home;
- mobile chamber.

## Required Final Contents

- RUN_ID
- completed stages
- accepted runtime level count
- new mechanisms
- main visual changes
- test results
- screenshot paths
- known issues
- key commit hashes
- push status
