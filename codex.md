## 2026-06-25 - Reset After Failed v8 Reboot

Phase: failure declaration and repository cleanup.

User decision:
- The current v8 implementation is failed.
- Stop repairing or polishing the existing implementation.
- Delete local implementation files.
- Delete the remote reboot branch.
- Keep only necessary explanatory and record documents.
- Push the resulting reset state to `main`.

Actions taken:
- Read the specified goal objective file before continuing.
- Confirmed current branch and remote state.
- Confirmed the failed reboot branch was at pushed commit `50b3d62`.
- Confirmed `origin/main` was at `9a22d58` before reset.
- Confirmed no local dev server session was still available and no listener was found on port `5173`.
- Switched to `main` and pulled `origin/main` with `--ff-only`.
- Verified the absolute path before deletion: `E:\OneDrive\MOSS\4_c_er\学习记录\Proj\Game-1`.
- Removed all repository contents except `.git`.
- Recreated only the reset notice, failure record, and this local handoff log.

Files intentionally kept or recreated:
- `README.md`
- `codex.md`
- `docs/reboot/FAILED_ROUND.md`
- `docs/reboot/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

Files intentionally removed from `main`:
- Application source and UI implementation.
- Server implementation.
- Build output and dependency folders.
- Previous generated reboot implementation docs and screenshots.
- Uncommitted v8 review-package drafts.

Verification commands and results:
- `git status --short --branch`: confirmed current failed branch and uncommitted v8 drafts before reset.
- `git remote -v`: confirmed `origin` is `https://github.com/Udkam/Game-1.git`.
- `git ls-remote --heads origin ...`: confirmed main, backup branch, and failed reboot branch existed before cleanup.
- `git switch -f main; git pull --ff-only origin main`: switched to `main`; result was already up to date.
- Path guard before deletion succeeded; wipe command refused to run unless cwd matched the expected `Game-1` absolute path.

Risks:
- The failed implementation is no longer present on `main`.
- The deleted reboot branch should not be used as a continuation point.
- Backup branch and tag are retained intentionally for provenance unless the user explicitly requests deleting them too.

Next steps:
- Commit and push this documentation-only reset to `main`.
- Delete `origin/reboot/parabox-worldline-v8-reboot-parabox-worldline-20260624-023038-2a151f`.
- Verify `main` contains only the record files.
