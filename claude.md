# Driftbox Work Report

RUN_ID: `v7-loop-20260623-195154-f683`

## Current direction

Driftbox is now in a v7 rebuild loop. The previous v6 2.5D route is considered failed for product acceptance and is no longer the user-facing mainline.

The v7 target is a 70-level 2D sci-fi Sokoban-variant puzzle game with:

- redesigned home, chapter star map, game HUD, win flow, mechanism archive, challenge record, settings/help, and chapter progress;
- quantum-lab visual direction;
- a new quantum-drone character;
- new mechanism families: time split, portals, multi-agent sync, chain state, spatial swaps, lightweight recursion, and fair misdirection;
- structured per-level design notes and verification status;
- replay validation preserved on the backend;
- visual screenshots and audits as hard acceptance gates.

Current runtime status:

- Stage 5 has switched the exposed runtime catalog to a 15-level v7 vertical slice.
- The slice includes startup/core puzzles, quantum portals, synchronized actors, mirrored sync, and time-shadow gate puzzles.
- It is verified through shared replay/solver paths, but it is not the final 70-level acceptance build.

## v6 archival note

The v6 2.5D work remains available through git history only as historical context. It must not be described as the current finished direction, and its public runtime entries are being retired during the v7 loop.
