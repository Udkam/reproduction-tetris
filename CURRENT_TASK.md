# Current Task — T5 Rules Repair and Aqua Blueprint Rebuild

Branch: `codex/tetris-recovery`

Core/rule authority: `4c8582854088695ebac90467842dc2bc0cef3a20`

Current historical ancestor: `dd7e31ea3547c18a797b2308f04161310d1412ce`
(rejected T4 presentation candidate)

Preserved rejected follow-up: local branch
`codex/tetris-t4-rejected-preservation` at
`1362c664629b2a83f0659f836259b84c21750fee`

Status: **active — T5 contract frozen; core implementation is the first writer slice**

## User-visible problems to resolve

1. Replace the current frontend and block treatment with a new light cyan/light-blue,
   high-contrast design.
2. Add a dedicated entry page with separate Marathon, Race, and Puzzle entrances.
3. Make Race endless accelerating normal play. It has no line target and stops only
   through player exit or top-out.
4. Repair Puzzle consecutive-piece play, unlock every level, remove numeric-difficulty
   gating, and replace short obvious queues with longer authored challenges.

## Baseline policy

- Do not reset or rewrite `dd7e31e`; it remains a historical ancestor.
- Do not merge the rejected T4 preservation branch into T5.
- Migrate the valid 44 px and real-UI QA requirements into T5, not the old T4 styling.
- Do not modify T3/T4 screenshots, manifests, fixtures, capture scripts, or logs.
- New fixtures, logs, and browser evidence use T5-specific paths.

## Slice A — T5 Core

Task ID: `TETRIS-T5-CORE-001`

The core writer may change only:

- `src/game/core/constants.ts`, `engine.ts`, `puzzles.ts`, `types.ts`, and `index.ts`
  if public exports require it;
- directly related tests under `src/game/core/*.test.ts`, including a new focused
  Puzzle-flow test if useful;
- `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.ts`, `qaScenario.test.ts`, `GameRuntime.ts`, and
  `GameRuntime.test.ts` only to migrate the obsolete Race-completion QA surface;
- `src/leaderboard.ts` and `src/leaderboard.test.ts` for endless-Race records;
- new `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-core/**` fixtures and `THREAD_LOG.md`.

The core writer must not edit `src/App.tsx`, `src/styles.css`,
`src/puzzleProgress.ts`, `src/game/render/**`, T3/T4 evidence, coordinator docs,
changelog, or the frontend log.

Core acceptance:

- no Race line count produces `finished`;
- Race speed uses locked pieces plus cleared lines, grows monotonically, and reaches
  its safe cap;
- every Puzzle level has 10–16 pieces, at least four piece types, a validated
  nontrivial public-command reference, and exact restart/hash behavior;
- soft drop can reach the floor, complete lock delay, and continue the queue;
- hard-drop and line-clear paths spawn the exact next authored piece;
- focused tests and the new T5 verifier pass;
- candidate SHA and exact evidence are logged before independent read-only QA.

## Slice B — T5 Frontend

Task ID: `TETRIS-T5-FRONTEND-001`

This slice remains blocked until the core candidate and independent core QA exist.

The frontend writer may change only:

- `src/App.tsx`;
- `src/styles.css`;
- `src/puzzleProgress.ts` and `src/puzzleProgress.test.ts`;
- `src/game/render/theme.ts`;
- `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`;
- `src/game/render/presentation.ts` and its test when necessary;
- new components under `src/ui/**`;
- directly related frontend/presentation tests when required;
- new `docs/workstreams/tetris-t5-frontend/THREAD_LOG.md`.

The frontend writer must not change core rules, Puzzle definitions/fixtures, build
configuration, dependencies, T3/T4 evidence, changelog, or coordinator docs.

Frontend acceptance:

- dedicated three-entry mode home;
- all Puzzle levels enabled, no numeric difficulty UI, completion only informational;
- Race copy/statistics contain no 20-line goal or remaining-line value;
- Aqua Blueprint tokens and completely new cell renderer;
- all visible buttons at least 44 × 44 CSS px and visible focus treatment;
- accessible pause/exit/result action sheets;
- one canvas per gameplay screen and no lifecycle leaks;
- targeted component/presentation checks before coordinator final gates.

## Coordinator final integration

After both accepted slices and the last product change, run exactly one final:

1. `npm.cmd run typecheck`;
2. `npm.cmd run test`;
3. `npm.cmd run build`;
4. T5 browser-evidence pass at every required viewport.

Browser evidence must use visible UI, exercise at least three consecutive Puzzle locks,
and compare visible level/remaining values with canonical state. Internal state
replacement is not valid setup evidence.

The coordinator routes the exact combined candidate to independent read-only QA,
resolves findings with newly bounded writer slices, updates
`docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`, commits the documentation delta, and decides whether to push.
