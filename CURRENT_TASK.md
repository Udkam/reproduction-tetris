# Current Task — T3 Production Chain

Branch: `codex/tetris`

## Accepted planning inputs

- D5 Mineral Shelf design: `4e13fcc01f2fec703e66f9027d7df25847bbe235`
  with independent QA `e31a0b665ff0864a0af35ab05dde4072bc96bbf5`.
- T3R six-level campaign/rules: `a096d96056457ebd2158bb6955cf7760fc36e238`
  with independent QA `0cf78e3efccff4ee9dff0098d231b48f3dec5657`.
- T2 production/QA remains historical evidence only. Its dark Offset Drop surface and
  three line-target Puzzle definitions are superseded.

Status: **documentation baseline being integrated; T3 production not yet implemented
or accepted**.

The T3 production chain is atomic for publication: C1 core correctness must be
independently accepted before V1 starts, but the branch is not labelled or published
as a completed T3 milestone until V1 and final browser evidence pass.

## Active next slice: T3-C1 Core campaign

Owner: the Tetris gameplay/rules implementation task.

### Exact authorized product paths

- `src/game/core/types.ts`
- `src/game/core/puzzles.ts`
- `src/game/core/engine.ts`
- `src/game/core/index.ts`
- `src/game/core/puzzles.test.ts`
- `src/game/core/core.test.ts`
- `src/game/core/rules.test.ts`
- optional new `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.ts`
- optional new `src/game/core/puzzleCampaign.test.ts`
- `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.ts`
- `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts`
- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t3-core/THREAD_LOG.md`

The two runtime QA-scenario paths are the sole consumer-migration exception: they may
replace the hard-coded legacy `offset-02` fixture with an accepted T3R level ID and
update its deterministic expectations, but may not change runtime architecture.

No other path is writable in C1. In particular, C1 may not edit React, CSS, Pixi,
GameRuntime, input, audio, persistence, package/config, root documents, Temple files,
or `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Required behavior

1. Replace the three old `offset-*` definitions with the accepted six T3R definitions.
2. Validate full 20 × 10 non-empty authored boards, initially empty hidden buffer,
   supported cells, no initially complete row, fixed non-empty queue, and
   `pieceBudget === queue.length`.
3. Add canonical/hashable queue index, canonical-board-empty goal, completion code,
   completed-level ID, and next-unlocked-level ID.
4. Use the existing public move/rotate/drop/lock/line-resolution path. Do not inject
   solved state, directly clear cells after initialization, add undo, or add random
   refill.
5. Apply the frozen fail order after every lock:
   top-out/hidden occupancy → board-empty success → budget/queue failure → next
   authored spawn → blocked-spawn failure.
6. Restart reconstructs the exact level/queue/index/initial hash. Replay remains
   deterministic and ends at the first terminal state.
7. State hash includes every rule-relevant Puzzle field.
8. Keep `puzzleTargetLines` only as a deprecated compile bridge if whole-repo
   typecheck requires it. It must be read by no core rule and must be removed by V1.
   Do not add another compatibility layer.

### C1 tests

Tests must prove:

- all six definitions validate and all accepted reference command sequences solve to
  full canonical-board occupancy zero;
- hidden residual cells, visible residual cells, initial full row, invalid cell/row,
  empty queue, budget mismatch, invalid/blocked spawn, top-out, queue exhaustion, and
  trailing terminal commands fail closed;
- final-piece empty-board success precedes budget failure;
- queue index advances exactly once per successful spawn;
- restart, double replay, command/event order, initial/final hash, and cell
  conservation are deterministic;
- Marathon and Race rules/hashes remain unchanged;
- no core imports from React/Pixi/DOM/storage/audio/browser/runtime.

### C1 execution and gate

- Use targeted tests while editing.
- After the final source change, run once: typecheck, complete Vitest suite, and build.
- No production browser evidence is required for C1 because the old shell is an
  explicitly temporary compile bridge.
- Produce one candidate SHA with exact paths and workstream log, then stop for
  independent QA.
- Do not start V1, push the candidate, or claim the game is visually correct.

## Reserved later slice: T3-V1 Mineral Shelf production

V1 opens only after independent C1 acceptance and a new coordinator instruction.

Reserved owner: the Tetris frontend implementation task.

Reserved paths:

- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/styles.css`
- `src/game/render/TetrisRenderer.ts`
- `src/game/render/theme.ts`
- `src/game/render/presentation.ts`
- `src/game/render/presentation.test.ts`
- `src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.ts`
- `src/game/runtime/GameRuntime.test.ts`
- `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.ts`
- `src/game/runtime/qaScenario.test.ts`
- optional new `src/puzzleProgress.ts`
- optional new `src/puzzleProgress.test.ts`
- final T3 browser-evidence script and `docs/qa/evidence/tetris-t3/**`
- `docs/workstreams/tetris-t3-frontend/THREAD_LOG.md`

V1 must bind real C1 state to the accepted D5 layout, six production level names,
versioned fail-closed unlock persistence, one Next, board-contained pause, five
controls, and final responsive browser evidence. It must remove the deprecated line
target/UI bridge. It may not change core rules or authored level data.

## Frozen non-goals

- No fourth mode, multiplayer, accounts, backend, online leaderboard, level editor,
  solver-generated hints, Puzzle undo, Hold/暂存, DOM cell grid, renderer rewrite, or
  copied commercial assets/trade dress.
- No Temple changes and no staging of the pre-existing untracked
  `docs/screenshots/temple/`.
- No broad dependency, build-tool, or package changes.
- No repeated full suites or captures for reassurance.

## Integration policy

The coordinator alone integrates accepted C1 and V1 commits, resolves workstream-log
divergence, updates `docs/logs/CHANGELOG.md`, performs final live review, and pushes
`codex/tetris`. QA/design acceptance never self-authorizes the next slice.
